    <h1 style={{backgroundColor:"lightgreen"}}>About Idukki Wildlife Sanctuary</h1>
    <p>
      <p>Cradled by the Cheruthoni and Periyar Rivers, the Idukki Wildlife Sanctuary is an embodiment of all the natural splendour and beauty the district is endowed with. Situated at about 450-750 m above sea level, the sanctuary covers around 77 square kilometres of dense jungles that surround the Idukki Arch Dam. It is located on the banks of the Idukki Arch Dam almost 40km from Thodupuzha.

The first hydroelectric project in the state, the Idukki Dam doesn’t just power the state with electricity but rather, offers visitors the most rejuvenating and enlivening experiences ever. The lush green mountains that rise majestically beyond the lake is in itself a sight to behold. 

Apart from its rich biodiversity, the Idukki Wildlife Sanctuary also holds immense cultural and historical significance. The indigenous tribes of the region, have coexisted with the wildlife here for generations. Their traditional knowledge and practices are deeply intertwined with the natural rhythms of the forest. Legends say that the Kuravan and Karachi hills across which the dam is built are in fact a mythical couple. According to local stories two people from the local tribe, Kuravan and Kurathi, were turned into stone by Lord Rama for having seen his consort Sita bathing in the river. As they had never been apart before, they begged for mercy. Lord Rama assured them that they would remain together and put the said stone mountains on either side of the Periyar River. It is Chemban Kolumban who was a member of the local Oorali tribe who became a trusted accomplice and helped the engineers with the geography of the area as he was well versed with the jungles.

The beautiful lake here lies sprawled across 33 square kilometres making it quite a sight. A boat cruise on the lake is the ideal way in which to soak in its magnificence and beauty. Ideal for romantic boat rides as well, the deciduous and tropical evergreen trees here add to the charm of this exquisite, awe inspiring destination. 

The ecotourism activities conducted by the forest department here are an ideal option for those who wish to explore the wilderness and its beauty in depth. The diversity of the habitats within this sanctuary is astonishing. Sightings of elephants, bison, sambar deer, wild dogs, jungle cats, tigers and wild boar along with various species of snake including cobras, vipers, kraits and many non-poisonous snakes are commonplace here. There is also a vibrant range of bird species found here including the Grey Jungle Fowl, Malabar Grey Hornbill, woodpeckers and bulbuls.

The Idukki Wildlife Sanctuary is not just another place to visit but rather, a sanctuary for the soul and a refuge from the chaos of modern life. Here, amidst the timeless beauty of nature, one can reconnect with the earth and rediscover the wonders of the natural world. Whether it's the sight of a rare bird taking flight or the rustle of leaves as a gentle breeze passes through, every moment spent here reminds one of the intrinsic harmony and resilience of the natural world. It is a testament to Kerala's rich biodiversity with its pristine landscapes, diverse ecosystems, and abundant wildlife. </p>
      <h3>Description</h3>
Idukki Wildlife Sanctuary is a forest area around the catchment area of Idukki Dam (Idukki Reservoir). The clearing of hectares of rainforest for the Idukki hydropower project has caused significant damage to the wildlife there.[1] In view of this, it was decided to protect the surrounding area. Idukki Wildlife Sanctuary is spread over Thodupuzha, and Udumbanchola taluks.[2] The sanctuary covers an area of 105.364 km2 (40.7 sq mi), out of which 72 km2 (27.8 sq mi) is forest land and 33 km2 (12.7 sq mi) is water body of reservoir.[2] The place was declared a wildlife sanctuary on 9 February 1976, as per government order numbered GO.7898/FM3/76/AD/09.02.76.[3] The sanctuary is located at an elevation of 450 to 1272 meters above sea level.[2] The highest peak in the sanctuary is Vanjur Medu which has a height of 1,272 m (4,173.2 ft).[2]

The Idukki, Cheruthoni and Kulamavu dams are located in this sanctuary. The Wildlife Sanctuary Warden is headquartered at Vellapara near Pinea. The nature study camps of the forest department are held here regularly. The district headquarters of Idukki, Painavu is located within the sanctuary.[citation needed]

<h3>Weather and Temperature</h3>
The average temperature in the sanctuary varies from 15°C to 25°C, with the hottest months being March and April.[2]

<h3>Flora and fauna</h3>
The tree species found in Idukki wildlife sanctuary include ceylon ironwood, thampakam (Hopea parviflora), large-flowered bay tree, wild jack (Artocarpus hirsutus), pali (Palaquium ellipticum), malampunna (Calophyllum polyanthum), Vernonia arborea, karuva (Cinnamomum verum), teak, Indian rosewood, vella maruthu (Terminalia paniculata), Grewia tiliifolia and Malabar kino.[2]

Common animals found in the sanctuary include asian elephants, deer species like Sambar deer, Muntjac, Chevrotain, monkeys including Bonnet macaque and Nilgiri langur, squirrels including Indian giant squirrel, Wild dog, Wild boar, jungle cat, dhole and Jackal.[2] The sanctuary is also home to a large number of domestic animals including bulls, cows and buffaloes. They were trapped inside the wildlife sanctuary with the construction of the Idukki Dam in 1976.[4] Since the predator species are less here, the increased number of livestock is said to pose a threat to the wildlife listed under the Idukki Wildlife (Conservation) Act, 1972 as it reduces the amount of grass.[4]

The wildlife sanctuary is home to a number of birds including Greater Indian Hornbill, Heart-spotted woodpecker, Blue-bearded bee-eater, Malabar trogon, Black bulbul, Junglefowl, Laughingthrushes, Kingfisher and Peafowl.[1][5] The bird-butterfly survey conducted at the Idukki Wildlife Sanctuary in 2017 found many rare birds and butterflies. The survey was conducted by the Kerala Forest Department in collaboration with Warblers and Waders, a consortium of bird and nature lovers.[6] 163 species of birds and 107 species of butterflies were found in the survey.[6]

An increase in the number of butterfly species was reported in a survey conducted in the sanctuary in 2019. The survey on butterflies, birds, tortoises and ants was conducted by the Kerala Forest and Wildlife Department and the Travancore Natural History Society.[7] The management plan prepared 10 years ago recorded only 76 butterfly species, 2019 survey recorded 182 species.[7] The survey found butterflies including Papilio buddha, the state butterfly of Kerala, Southern Birdwing, the largest butterfly in India, The Golden tree flitter, the Painted Lady, migrating from Eurasia, the Malabar tree nymph, Common fivering, Common bush hopper, Yamfly and Common Nawab.[7][5]

<h3>Vairamani</h3>
Main article: Vairamani
Vairamani is an islet formed in the Idukki Reservoir within the Idukki Wildlife Sanctuary during summers.[8] This islet, without human intervention, is being turned into a breeding ground for many birds in the summer months.[8] Currently, the islet is accessible only by boat controlled by the Forest Department. The Vairamani village was submerged in water in 1974 when the reservoir of the Idukki Dam was filled with water.[9]</p>

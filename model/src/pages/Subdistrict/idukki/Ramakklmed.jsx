    <h1 style={{backgroundColor:"lightgreen"}}>About Ramakkalmedu</h1>
    <p>Located in Idukki district, around 40kms from Thekkady, is one of Asia’s windiest places - Ramakkalmedu. Perched in the midst of the sprawling Western Ghats, the lush green hills, crisp mountain air, and sweeping winds at Ramakkalmedu make for a treat to the senses.

A rejuvenating retreat for all nature lovers, this beautiful destination owes its name to the impressions of feet found on the rock surface here. These impressions are believed to be that of Lord Rama. According to the Indian epic Ramayana, Lord Rama is believed to be an incarnation of Lord Vishnu. Age old stories say that Lord Rama had visited this place during his hunt for his wife Sita. Therefore, as a land that was blessed by his presence, these hills were named Ramakkalmedu.

The hills of Ramakkalmedu offer visitors splendid panoramic views of the picturesque villages that lie in the neighbouring state of Tamil Nadu. A 300m high pillar like rocky structure that stands facing the east is another remarkable feature here. Being an exceedingly windy terrain, there are also several wind farms, that are undertakings of the Government of Kerala, located in the area that is used to generate over 10.5 MW of wind power.

The most interesting feature at Ramakkalmedu, apart from its natural beauty is perhaps the highest twin-statue that’s located here. The Kuravan and Kurathi statue portrays a tribal couple with their young child looking at the visitors nonchalantly. The other attractions here include different places like Turtle Rock, Frog Rock and so on.

These beautiful hills have a little something for everyone irrespective of whether you are in for a more laid-back picnic or a full on adventure. The trek in the midst of constant cold, powerful winds is enough to either give you a rush of adrenaline or to help you tune out from the rest of the world and tune in to the pulse of nature in its rawest form. Once you reach the hilltop, take a minute to take in the magnificence of the view that lies spread out before you. The picture perfect Kambam village of Tamil Nadu along the eastern slopes of the Western Ghats is indeed a sight to behold. At Puttadi, on the way from Munnar to Thekkady is Shankurandampara a huge rock that offers a panoramic view of the Ramakkalmedu.

It is an entirely different magic that envelops these hills in an embrace at dusk. As the sun slowly sets and the stars start to twinkle, you will find yourself sighing in awe at the beautiful vistas of nature that unfold before you. No two visitors will experience Ramakkalmedu the same way. It strikes a different note on the heartstrings of each visitor. 

Here, in the midst of ancient rocks and winds that whisper forgotten tales, one cannot help but feel a profound sense of belongingness. It is almost as if the land in itself reaches out and connects to those who tread it. A land where legends come alive, nature reigns supreme and the spirit finds solace and peace. </p>
    <p>Ramakkalmedu is a hill station and a hamlet in Idukki district in the Indian state of Kerala. The place is noted for its panoramic beauty and numerous windmills.

<h3>Location</h3>
It is located about 15 km from Nedumkandam on the Munnar-Thekkady route. Nearby towns are Thookkupalam (5 km), Kattappana (25 km), and Kumily (40 km).

<h3>Geography</h3>
Ramakkalmedu stands tall in the western ghats at a height of 3,500 ft (1,100 m) above sea level.

<h3>Flora and fauna</h3>
The ecosystem of the area consists largely of grass land Shola forest type which is laced by sporadic bamboo forests.

<h3>Climate</h3>
Constant wind is a defining characteristic that sets Ramakkalmedu apart. The area experiences a consistent wind speed of approximately 35 kilometers per hour year-round, regardless of the season or time of day.

<h3>Wind Energy</h3>
Villages such as Pushpakandam and Kuruvikanam near Ramakkalmedu are home to the second wind energy farm installation in Kerala. While these installations are on private holdings, they collectively have a current capacity of approximately 14.25 MW, utilizing NEG MICON Wind Mills. The electricity generated here is distributed to the Kerala State Electricity Board. Despite Ramakkalmedu being known as one of Asia's largest wind-blown areas, its potential for electricity generation remains largely untapped.

<h3>Tourism</h3>

View from Ramakkalmedu
Although Ramakkalmedu has the potential to become an international tourist destination and already attracts more than 100,000 visitors, as of 2015, not much had been done to improve basic facilities in the area. The government of Kerala has announced plans to develop this tourist destination by improving transportation facilities with buses, upgrading the Kerala police, and taking other measures. Tourist attractions such as Tortoise Rock, Kuravan Hills, Rama Rock, Wind Mills Viewpoint, Soolapara Hill, and Hyderamala Hills are all part of the Ramakkalmedu tourism circuit.

<h3>Kuravan and Kurathi</h3>

Kuravan and Kurathi statue, Ramakkalmedu
Ramakkalmedu is a historic site with a monument to Kuravan and Kurathi, a large statue that depicts the Sangam Period and Sangam landscape of Kerala and Tamil Nadu. The monument provides a panoramic view of Tamil Nadu villages and towns, including Cumbum, Theni, Kombai, Thevaram, Uthamapalayam, Bodinaykannor, and Vaiga. Rolling green hills and the fresh mountain air make Ramakkalmedu an enchanting retreat. The view is striking at dusk when all these towns in Tamil Nadu are lit up.

Ramakkalmedu, the name of the place, literally means "Land of Rama’s Stone" or "Land where Rama set his holy foot" (Rama is a Hindu deity in the epic Ramayana). One story suggests that Rama, accompanied by his younger brother Lakshmana, set his foot at the top of Ramakkalmedu in search of his wife Sita, who had been abducted by the rakshasa king of Lanka, Ravana.

The Twin Statue was sculpted by C.B. Jinan and erected on the hill's summit in the year 2005. This statue depicts two historical characters with a connection to the construction of the Idukki Dam. The Idukki Arch dam links two massive rock hills named Kuravan Mala (Kuravan Hill) and Kurathi Mala (Kurathi Hill).[1]

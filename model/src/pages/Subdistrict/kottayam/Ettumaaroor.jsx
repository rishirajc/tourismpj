    <h1 style={{backgroundColor:"lightgreen"}}>About Ettumanoor Mahadevar Temple</h1>
   
   <p>Ettumanoor Mahadeva temple is an ancient Shiva temple in Kottayam, Kerala,[1] India. The temple is one of the major Shiva temples in Kerala, along with Vaikom Temple, Kaduthruthy Mahadeva Temple, Chengannur Mahadeva Temple, Vazhappally Maha Siva Temple, Ernakulam Shiva Temple, Vadakkunathan temple and Sreekanteswaram Mahadeva Temple, Thiruvananthapuram.[2]

The name of the place had its mythological origin from the word 'man oor' in Malayalam, which means the place of deer as 'maan' means deer and 'oor' means place. Another version is that the name originated from the 'Ettu Mana Ooru', ie, 'The Land of Eight Namboothiri Manas' or 'Ashta Grihas'. These Eight Manas (Brahmin families) are the original Ooralans of great Ettumanoor Mahadeva Temple. It is also believed that at this place (ooru) Lord Siva appeared in Eight (Ettu) different forms (maanam) and hence the name Ettumanoor.[3] Temple tradition has it that the Pandavas and the sage Vyasa had worshipped at this temple.[</p>
    <p>Ettumanoor Mahadeva temple is an ancient Shiva temple in Kottayam, Kerala, India. Temple tradition has it that the Pandavas and the sage Vyasa had worshipped at this temple. It is believed that at this place [ooru] Lord Siva appeared in Eight [ Ettu] different forms [ maanam] and hence the name Ettumanoor.

The present temple building, with its gopuram and the fortress around it, was reconstructed in 717 ME (1542 AD). There are Dravidian mural paintings on the walls inside and outside of the main entrance. The fresco of Pradosha Nritham (Dance of Shiva) is one of the finest wall paintings in India.

Temple is administered by Travancore Devaswom Board</p>
<p><h3>Ezhara Ponnana</h3>
The annual Ezhara Ponnana procession at the Ettumanoor Sree Mahadeva Temple in Kottayam is one of the most captivating sights associated with Kerala’s temple festivals. Ezhara Ponnana translates to seven-and-a-half golden elephants, representing seven two-foot-high elephants and one additional elephant standing at just one foot tall, collectively known as the 'seven-and-half elephants.'

Celebrated in the Malayalam month of Kumbham (February – March), the festival's highlight is the night procession of these golden elephants on the eighth day. The festival concludes with the Aaraattu ceremony on the tenth day, which falls on the Thiruvathira asterism. The procession also features caparisoned elephants and a traditional temple orchestra, adding to the grandeur of the occasion.

The Ettumanoor Mahadeva Temple, renowned for its ancient murals, including a notable depiction of Nataraja in the gopuram, holds a significant place in Kerala’s cultural and religious landscape. According to legend, the Pandavas and sage Vyasa worshipped at this temple, further enhancing its historical importance.

The temple's annual festival, featuring the Ezhara Ponnana, is celebrated with great fervor. The ten-day festival, commencing in Kumbham (February/March), includes the Aaraattu procession, elephant pageantry, and cultural performances.

The procession of the golden elephants is a night event on the eighth day of the festival. On the tenth day, the Aaraattu ceremony is held during the Thiruvathira asterism. The caparisoned elephants and traditional temple orchestra add a vibrant touch to the festivities.

Legend has it that the golden elephants were offered to the temple deity by the Travancore ruler, Anizham Thirunal Marthanda Varma. These golden elephants, made from jackfruit wood and covered with nearly thirteen kilograms of gold, are kept in the temple vault and displayed once a year during the festival.

The Ezhara Ponnana Darshanam (ceremonial sighting) is perceived as a symbol of luck and is the high point of the festival. Taking place at midnight on the eighth day, this grand spectacle, featuring the golden statuettes alongside caparisoned elephants and traditional temple orchestra, offers a once-in-a-lifetime experience, reflecting Kerala's rich religious and cultural history.</p>
<p><h3>The Temple</h3>

padinjare nada (Western entrance) of the temple
The present temple building, with its gopuram and the fortress around it, was reconstructed in 717 ME (1542 AD). There are Dravidian mural paintings on the walls inside and outside of the main entrance. The fresco of Pradosha Nritham (Dance of Shiva) is one of the finest wall paintings in India. There is a golden flagstaff inside the temple topped with an idol of a bull surrounded by small bells and metal banyan tree leaves. In terms of architecture, these temples stand out to be an ultimate testament for the Vishwakarma Sthapathis for their engineering skills. The temple roofs are covered with copper sheets, and it has 14 ornamental tops. Bhagavathi, Sastha, Dakshinamoorthy, Ganapathy and Yakshi are installed here as subordinate deities. There is a separate temple for Lord Krishna. It is believed that the philosopher Adi Sankaracharya wrote 'Soundarya Lahari' while staying in the temple.[5]

The origin of the name Ettumanoorappan is from Kattampakk, a small village in Kottayam district.

<h3>Festival</h3>

The famed Ezhara Ponnana festival
Ettumanoor Mahadeva Temple hosts the arattu festival, celebrated on a grand scale on the Thiruvathira day in February–March each year. Many people come to the temple on the 8th and 10th day of the festival, when seven and a half elephants (in Malayalam: ezharaponnaana)[6] made of gold (nearly 13 Kgms) will be held in public view. This statue was donated to the temple by a travancore maharaja. The temple, one of the wealthiest Devaswoms in Kerala, has many valuable possessions.

The Thulabharam is one of the important rituals of this temple. People make offerings to God for favors received. On balance, the child or man for whom offerings were promised to God, is weighed against offerings ranging from gold to fruits.

<h3>Ezharaponnana</h3>
Ezhara Ponnana refers to the seven-large sized and one small sized-golden elephant (that is called Ezharaponnana), all of which are kept in the temple vault and taken out once a year for darshan by the devotees. Of the eight statuettes, seven have a height of two ft., and the eighth one is half that size, hence the name Ezhara (seven-and- a- half) Ponnana (Golden elephants). According to legend, they were presented to the temple by Anizham Thirunal Marthanda Varma, the founder of the Travancore kingdom. According to another story, while Marthanda Varma had made the pledge to present the ‘ponnana’, the offering was made during the reign of his successor, Maharaja Karthika Thirunal. There are also differing stories about the reason for the offering: some believe it was offered as a penalty for the damages suffered by the temple during the annexation of Thekkumcore by Travancore; others believe it was the offering made when the marauding army of the Tipu Sultan was hammering on the gates of Travancore. The statuettes are made of a jackfruit tree and covered in gold plates weighing nearly 13 kg.[7]

The Ezhara Ponnana Darshan is one of the high points of the temple festival, held at midnight on the eighth day of the ten-day festival. Ezhara Ponnana Darshan begins with the ceremonial procession of the eight golden elephant statuettes. They are later kept at the Asthana Mandapam for the annual darshan by the devotees.[8]

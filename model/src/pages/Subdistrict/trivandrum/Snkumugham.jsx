    <p>Shankhumugham Beach in Thiruvananthapuram is a beloved spot for both locals and visitors alike, offering a perfect blend of relaxation and scenic beauty. Renowned for its tranquil vibe, many people visit the beach to witness its stunning sunsets, while others find solace during the day amidst the gentle breeze and the expansive view of the Arabian Sea. The beach's rustic charm is further accentuated by the presence of local fishermen and several picturesque vantage points that make it an ideal spot for picnics.

One of the beach's most iconic features is the Matsya Kanyaka sculpture, a 35-meter-long mermaid structure that stands as a unique and impressive landmark in the state. In addition to this, the beach hosts a special Indoor Recreation Centre and a beautiful Children's Park, making it a great destination for families.

Shankhumugham Beach is not just about its natural beauty; it also holds cultural significance. It is considered the 'Arattukadavu' of Sri Ananthapadmanabhan, the presiding deity of Thiruvananthapuram. During special occasions, thousands of Hindus perform 'Bali Tharpanam' rituals on its shores. The beach is also a prime location for the Ganesh Nimarjan ceremony during Vinayaka Chathurthi.</p>

Shanghumugham beach is considered as the ‘Arattukadavu’ of Sri Ananthapadmanabhan - the presiding deity of the city. [1] Thousands of Hindus perform ‘Bali Tharpanam’ during special occasions.[2] Shankhumugham is the prime location for Ganesh Nimarjan at the time of Ganesh Chaturthi.[3][4]

On the Arattu day at Thiruvananthapuram, idols of Lord Padmanabhaswamy, Lord Narasimha, and Lord Krishna are taken in procession to the Laccadive Sea at Shanghumugham beach.[5] His Highness the now-titular Maharaja of Travancore leads the procession with the royal sword in hand while escorted by members of the royal family, armed guards, temple authorities, mounted police, and officers. After the ceremonial bath at Shanghumugham, the idols are taken back in procession, thus marking the conclusion of the festival.[6]

The sculpture of Sagarakanyaka, a mermaid, by Kanayi Kunhiraman is an added attraction.[7] This giant statue is more than 35 metres long. The 'Jawaharlal Nehru Park of Traffic signs for children' is situated here,[8] which is helpful for the children to understand the traffic rules while playing in the park. The park also provides cycling facilities for small children.

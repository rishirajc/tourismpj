    <h1 style={{backgroundColor:"lightgreen"}}>About St. Angelo Fort</h1>
    <p>In 1498, during Vasco da Gama's visit to India, the local Kolathiri king granted the land to Portuguese to build a settlement in present-day Kerala. On 23 October 1505, he gave the Portuguese leader Francisco de Almeida the permission to build a fort at the site. The construction activity began the very next day, on 24 October 1505, when Goncalo Gil Barbosa - the Portuguese factor of Cannanore (Kannur) - laid the foundation stone. The construction of the wooden fort was completed on 30 October 1505: its first Captain was Lourenco Britto, who led a garrison of 150 Portuguese men, and controlled two ships in the sea. After the fort was completed, Almeida began using the title "Viceroy", and in 1507 he started the construction of a stone fort at the site.[1]

The fort was later attacked in vain by the local Indian ruler Zamorin and Kolathiri in the Siege of Cannanore (1507).


Fort at Kannur
In August 1509 Almeida, refusing to recognize Afonso de Albuquerque's as the new Portuguese governor to supersede himself, arrested him in this fortress after having fought the naval Battle of Diu. Afonso de Albuquerque was released after six months' confinement and become governor on the arrival of the grand-marshal of Portugal with a large fleet, in October 1509.[2]

The fort provided naval supplies for the Portuguese conquest of Goa and the Portuguese battles against the Mamluk. As the local Portuguese settlement at Kannur had no sources of revenue, the fort's expenses were met with funding from Goa, the seat of Portuguese rule in India.[1]

On 15 February 1663, the Dutch captured the fort from the Portuguese.[1] They modernised the fort and built the bastions Hollandia, Zeelandia and Frieslandia that are the major features of the present structure. The original Portuguese fort was pulled down later. A painting of this fort and the fishing ferry behind it can be seen in the Rijksmuseum Amsterdam. The Dutch sold the fort to king Ali Raja of Arakkal in 1772. In 1790 the British seized it and used it as their chief military station in Malabar until 1947.

The fort is in the Cannanore Cantonment area. It is fairly well preserved as a protected monument under the Archaeological Survey of India. St Angelo's fort is a most important historical monument and a popular tourist attraction. Six Tourism Policeman are posted here for protection duty.

In 2015, thousands of cannonballs weighing several kilos were discovered from the Fort premises. The Archaeological Survey of India, which led the excavation, believes these were buried as part of military preparedness.

Present status</p>
<p>St Angelo Fort in Kannur owns a vital position in the historical map of Kerala. Also known as the Kannur Fort, this historically significant place is built of laterite in a triangular shape. 

Constructed by the Portuguese Viceroy, Don Francesco de Almeida in 1505 CE, the walls of this fort virtually carry the chronicles of trade, colonialism and battles. The fort offers stunning views of Mapilla Bay, Dharmadam island and the harbour. </p>
   <p>Exploring a destination...
The joy of travel comes in exploring new things. Planting your feet somewhere you’ve never been before brings with it the rush of discovery and the joy of pushing back on the boundaries of your world.

But when one does arrive at that fresh frontier, there are ways better than others to begin your journey of discovery. Follow these steps and see the world with a new light.

• Discover a new city through a food tour. Food tour’s are the easiest way to take a tour, learn about the local delicacies, and the best of all, get great tips that aren’t just “local” tips for tourists, but sometimes, lessons for a lifetime too

• Use Public Transportation. When you are in a new city, you can possibly see places and people that you wouldn’t normally see when simply walking to the places that checks your list. Some buses or rails take you to parts of the city you wouldn’t get to see otherwise. Whilst using public transportation, just ensure that you are following the local norms and do remember to watch the locals!

• Find a local festival. Go beyond what other tourists might do while visiting a place. Look for the unique things you would want to do. Use social media or the local tourism website to find out what’s going on locally. You may have to move out of the center of the city to do some of the less popular but more unique things, so just keep that in mind!</p>

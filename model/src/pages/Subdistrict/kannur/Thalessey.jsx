    <h1 style={{backgroundColor:"lightgreen"}}>About Tellicherry Fort</h1>
    <p>ellicherry Fort is located in Thalassery (Tellicherry), a town in Kannur District of Kerala state, South India. Thalassery was one of the most important European trading centers in Kerala. The Fort lies on a group of low wooden hills running down to the sea and is protected by natural waters. It has been the main outlet for the rich spices, hill products, and timber of the vast hinterland.

The French were the first to engage in trading at Tellicherry, establishing a stronghold at Mahé, Puducherry, 5 km south of Tellicherry town. Toward the end of the 17th century, the British opened a factory north of Tellicherry. Later, they obtained a site from Vadakkelamkur, the de facto ruler of Kolathunad, and established a factory at Tellicherry in 1708. However, the Udayamangalam branch of the Kolathiri family and Korangoth Nair, the local chieftain, resented this action and launched an attack, causing serious damage to English property. In order to safeguard their trade activities, with the support of the Kolathiri Raja, they built a fort around the outlying hills of Tellicherry. The French occupation of Mahé in 1725 compelled the British Company to strengthen the fortification to establish a stronghold on the Malabar Coast. In 1736, the British took possession of Dharmadam Island. They maintained a strong military establishment at Tellicherry from 1776 to 1784.

In 1781, Hyder Ali, ruler of the Kingdom of Mysore, unsuccessfully attempted to capture the Fort during his campaign to control Malabar. His successor, Tipu Sultan, was forced to cede the Malabar District to the British in 1792, at the conclusion of the Third Anglo-Maratha War.

The Tellicherry fort, overlooking the sea, rises to a height of 10m and is oblong in plan. It was built out of laterite blocks with high round-holed walls and strong flanking bastions. Although the small redoubts on most of the outlying hills have long since disappeared, the Tellicherry fort is in a fair state of preservation. The square fort, with its massive walls, strong flanking bastions, secret tunnels to the sea, and intricately carved huge doors, is an imposing structure. A lighthouse marks the site of an old redoubt. The fort was once the nucleus of Thalassery's development. Tellicherry was also famous for the cricket matches played between Europeans and local teams near the seashore, which used to attract enormous crowds during those days. This is a centrally protected monument under the control of the Archaeological Survey of India since 1921.[1][2]</p>
    
    <p>Thalaserry fort, located at a distance of 22 kms from Kannur constructed in 1708 AD was the military centre of the British.

When the British East India Company established its settlement on the Malabar Coast, they built the Thalaserry Fort, as a testimonial to their colonial imperialism. In 1700, the British built the Thalassery Fort on a small hill called Tiruvellapadkunnu and in 1708, it was strengthened by increasing its height and with bastions.

 The fort is a square structure built of laterite and is distinguished by its massive ventilated walls and strong flanking bastions.  The fort has secret tunnels to the sea and intricately carved huge doors. It was here that Haider's captain was imprisoned.

 The fort has a cemetery and the collector's mansion nearby. Many British officials have been laid to rest in this cemetery that is named after Sir Edward Brennen.

The famous St.John's Anglican church is behind this fort.The fort was once the nucleus of Thalaserry's development.</p>

<p>Built by the East India Company in 1683 CE as part of a factory, for trade purposes and then later used as a military base and administrative centre for British rule in India, the Thalassery Fort has been witness to centuries of history. 

A formidable historical monument, the Thalassery Fort stands proud in the quaint town of Thalassery which is located 22kms from Kannur district in Kerala. Thalassery was once one of the most relevant and important European trading centres of God’s Own Country. Constructed in a strategically advantageous location the fort was built to withstand all forms of attacks or invasions. It is believed that it is a blend of jaggery, egg white and quick lime that was used to erect the fort that is flanked by bastions. Underground chambers that were once used to store goods like pepper and cardamom can still be seen. It is also believed that the East India Company also used to mint their coins here. 

The massive walls, exquisitely carved doors and mysterious tunnels that lead to the sea all make this fort a delight to visit and explore. Once at the centre of Thalassery’s development, the square shaped fort stands 90 feet above sea level and its entrance is set on a 10 meter tall wall. There is also a short lighthouse nearby that adds to its charm and more importantly, announces it as a harbour town.

An excellent example of the skill and craftsmanship of the architects of yesteryears, some of the underground chambers of the Thalassery Fort were once used as prisons while some others were used as administrative offices.  After independence the Fort housed government offices. It is in the year 1999 CE that the Archaeology Department of India took over the fort and started preserving and protecting it ever since. The nearby Holy Rosary Church can be seen from the premises of the fort. The Sardar palli (mosque) and the Jagannatha temple are two other notable places of worship that are located close to the fort. 

The Thalassery Fort has borne witness to history being written. It has seen rulers come and go. It has seen the growth of Thalassery from a small centre of trade to a full fledged town and then a location of great military significance. It has played a big role in the way in which this town has become rich in cultural and social tradition over the centuries that have passed. 

As you walk through its corridors and see its ancient walls, tread with caution and respect for history sleeps here. For those travellers who seek a glimpse into the storied past of Kerala, a visit to the Thalassery Fort is not to be missed for it offers one a captivating journey into the past through time. The sprawling grounds of the fort, its colossal walls and structures, the panoramic views of the Arabian Sea, and the exquisite architecture that has withstood the test of time, all set the perfect backdrop for an adventure like no other.</p>

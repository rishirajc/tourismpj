    <h1 style={{backgroundColor:"lightgreen"}}>About Gavi, Kerala</h1>
    <p>Gavi Eco-Tourism , a project of the Kerala Forest Development Corporation, has caught the attention of tourists for a while now. The project is exclusive in many respects and the majority who visited were nature lovers and adventure tourists. Over a short period of time visitors to Gavi gradually increased, especially after 'Alistair International' the world-acclaimed tourism major listed it among the leading eco-tourism centres and one of the must-see places in India.

A highlight of the Gavi Eco Project is the involvement of the local populace in its activities as guides, gardeners and cooks. This provides livelihood for the locals and also helps to create awareness on the conservation of nature. Gavi, located in Pathanamthitta district offers its visitors activities like trekking, wildlife watching, outdoor camping in specially built tents and night safaris.

The road leading to Gavi is blanketed by tea plantations, which itself is a refreshing experience. En route to Gavi are places of interest like Mundakayyam, Kuttikanam, Peermedu and Vandiperiyar from where the road deviates to Gavi.

Once you reach Gavi the serene eco-lodge 'Green Mansion' awaits you like a mother to embrace you in its protective fold. From the 'Green Mansion', one can savour the spectacular view of the Gavi Lake and the adjoining forests. Besides the accommodation provided in 'Green Mansion' visitors can also try out the tree houses here and can even pitch tents in the wilderness. Here one can have outstanding trekking experiences, which are overseen by trained local people. Those who would love to be left alone can do so in the tranquil environs of Gavi or may even go canoeing in the placid waters of the lake or enjoy a breathtaking sunset. Visitors are usually provided vegetarian food and snacks, which further adds to the eco-friendly ambience of the place.

The place is rich in flora and fauna. There are hills and valleys, tropical forests, sprawling grasslands, sholas, cascading waterfalls and cardamom plantations. Endangered species including the Nilgiri Tahr and Lion-Tailed Macaque are often sighted on the outskirts of Gavi. With more than 260 species of birds including the Great Pied Hornbill, Woodpecker and Kingfishers, Gavi is literally a paradise for birdwatchers.

Some of the breathtaking viewpoints at Gavi like the Valley View offer a spectacular view of the deep ravine and forest below. From Kochu Pampa, a point near Green Mansion eco-lodge, one can track the grazing Nilgiri Tahrs.

The famous pilgrim destination, Sabarimala is a short trek from Gavi. For those interested in observing nocturnal wildlife, night safaris to Kullur, Gavi Pullumedu, Kochu Pampa and Pachakanam provide ample opportunities for wildlife viewing.

Another unique feature of Gavi is camping in the forests. One can pitch a tent in the camping site, which is a rarity in many Indian forests. As dusk stretches into the silence of the night, one can feel the presence of wildlife in the middle of nowhere, an experience that cannot be explained in words. There are also tree-top houses where one can enjoy avian life to the fullest.

The active involvement of tribals in Gavi makes it a unique venture of its kind in the country. Traditional knowledge of the forest and its way of life helps Gavi to sustain its surroundings in its original state.</p>

The tree, which is identified as gopher, is known as nirampalli. Gopher wood or gopherwood is a term used once in the Bible. There is no consensus about what modern species is meant by "gopher wood".

The tree standing at Gavi forest is of robust stem and lush foliage. According to state Forest Department officials, though the fully-grown gopher in Gavi is the only such tree sighted in the periphery of the jungle, possibly there could be more such trees still surviving in the inner forests of Periyar Tiger Reserve (PTR) in Kerala.

<p><h2>Gavi - The eco-tourism experience</h2>
Drawing on the wild and natural beauty of the place, the State-run Kerala Forest Development Corporation has developed an eco-tourism project to attract more Nature lovers and adventure tourists to the place. 

It takes a two-hour journey by jeep from Kumily to reach picturesque Gavi which is blanketed by the greenery of tea plantations. Advance booking with the Kerala Forest Development Corporation is appreciated as entry passes have to be obtained from the forest check post en route at Vallakkadavu.

<h4>Packages</h4>
There are three different tour packages offered by the KFDC at Gavi.  The first is a day-time package from 8 am to 4.30 pm. The overnight package provides for accommodation at Green Mansions, the eco-tourism centre near the lake. In another overnight package, guests spend the night at a jungle camp site to which they are taken in jeeps.

<h4>Ambience</h4>
The picturesque beauty of the place attracts a steady stream of visitors including deep jungle trekkers, bird watchers, Nature lovers, research students, and those looking for a break from the daily grind. The recently introduced eco-tourism project by the Kerala Forest Development Corporation provides a memorable wildlife and jungle experience.

<h4>En-route Gavi</h4>
During the two-hour jeep ride to Gavi, one has to drive past hills, valleys, tropical forests, grasslands, sholas, gushing waterfalls and cardamom plantations. All along the way are beautiful places like  Mundakkayam, Kuttikkanam, Peerumedu and Vandiperiyar where one gets to see Nature at her best.

As Gavi is adjacent to the Periyar Tiger Reserve, visitors will have to pass through a large area of the reserve forests.  The view of the amazing greenery and a glimpse into the wildlife are two of the major attractions of the journey.

An important landmark en-route is the Pampa Reservoir. The Pullumedu peak is also on the way.

In Gavi
Cooling off in the waters of bubbling brooks among thick greenery inhaling the fresh air scented with the aroma of cardamom is a magical experience that very few places other than Gavi can offer. The wild animals like the Nilgiri Langurs, the herds of elephants and the diverse avian fauna make the place all the more attractive.

<h4>Activities involved in the project</h4>
The eco-tourism project have come up with various activities for visitors including treks  in deep jungles, night safaris, outdoor camping, elephant safaris, wildlife watching, bird-watching, stays atop tree huts, visits to Paradise Cove at Ninnumulli, boating in Gavi and Kochupampa lakes, stays at the eco-lodge overlooking Gavi Lake, leisurely walks through spice gardens, visits to cardamom factories and so on. 

A team of KFDC men supervises the various tour packages offered to visitors. During  treks and jungle expeditions, visitors can avail the services of guides. From Gavi, one can trek to Meenar, Chenthamara Kokka and Valley View. The trekking course passes through patches of dense forest. During treks into the deep jungle, apart from guides, there will be a local 'elephant chaser' accompanying visitors. They are also called patanki men and they use their ingenious noise-making device to protect the team from dangerous wildlife encounters.

Meenar offers tranquil and pristine natural beauty while the Chenthamara Kokka offers a scenic view of the dangerously alluring deep ravine with thick forests below.

A boat-ride across Paradise Cove at Ninnumulli is another magnificent experience. The cove has many exquisite wild flowers and one can also hear the musical chirping of birds in the backdrop. 

The KFDC has organized outdoor camping and night safaris at Kullur, Gavi Pullumedu, Kochu Pampa and Pachakanam. Through these camps and safaris, visitors can enjoy the dark beauty of the tropical rain forests at night as well as night-life in the jungle. If you are the very adventurous sort, you could also try night camping in the forest, an unforgettable experience. Tree houses are also available for use by campers.

Guests can also take a walk through the spice gardens and visit the cardamom factory near Gavi.

<h4>Accommodation</h4>
Apart from tree houses and tents that are put up in the jungle, there is an eco-lodge, Green Mansion, set up by the KFDC at Gavi. The stay at the Green Mansion is a unique experience. It offers a spectacular view of Lake Gavi and the forests around. A short trek from Green Mansion will take you to Kochu Pampa, where you can spot the endangered Nilgiri Tahrs.

<h4>Conservation efforts</h4>
The eco-tourism project is planned in such a way that it supports the KFDC’s conservation efforts. Apart from taking all measures to avoid the slightest of disturbances to the eco-system, the project also creates awareness among visitors about the necessity to protect the forest and the wildlife. The eco-friendly measures that are adhered to during the adventure travels are appreciable and the journey through the forests is explorative and educative.

<h4>Involvement of local populace</h4>
The eco-tourism project at Gavi is conceived in such a way that it involves the local community. The local tribal community is actively involved in the tourism projects and often act as guides, cooks and gardeners. This gives them a much needed extra income and helps them make a living. As they have abundant knowledge of the forest, they are able to lead visitors expertly through the Nature trails and offer them a lot of information on the flora and fauna of any area.</p>

    <h1 style={{backgroundColor:"lightgreen"}}>About Ashtamudi Lake</h1>
    <p>Ashtamudi Lake (Ashtamudi Kayal, ml: "അഷ്ടമുടിക്കായൽ" ), in the Kollam District of the Indian state of Kerala is a unique wetland ecosystem and a large palm-shaped (also described as octopus-shaped) water body. It is second only in size to the Vembanad estuary ecosystem of the state. Ashtamudi means 'eight hills or peaks' (Ashta : 'eight'; mudi : 'peaks') in the local Malayalam language. The name is indicative of the lake's topography with its multiple branches. The lake is also called the gateway to the backwaters of Kerala and is well known for its houseboat and backwater resorts.[1][2][3] Ashtamudi Wetland was included in the list of wetlands of international importance, as defined by the Ramsar Convention for the conservation and sustainable utilization of wetlands. [4] Ashtamudi Estuary is the deepest among all the estuaries in Kerala, with a maximum depth of 6.4 meters at the confluence zone.</p>
  <p>Along both banks of the lake and its backwater canals, coconut groves and palm trees interspersed with towns and villages are seen. Kollam, (formerly Quilon) is an important historic port city located on the right bank of the lake. Boat cruises are operated by the Kollam Boat Club from Kollam to Alappuzha providing transport access to many other towns and villages along this route. Luxury houseboats also operate on the lake. The boat journey is an 8-hour trip, winding through lakes, canals and water bound villages.[citation needed] Chinese fishing nets, called cheena vala in Malayalam, are used by local fisherman and are a common sight along the waterway.[1][5][6]

The lake and the city of Kollam on its banks and the Neendakara port at the confluence offer a means of transport for the state's trade and commerce in the cashew trading and processing industry as well as the marine products industry.[6]

The lake is the source of livelihood of many people living close by. Fishing, coconut husk retting for coir production and inland navigation services are the prominent businesses.

In 2014, the Clam Governing Council of Ashtamudi lake became the first Marine Stewardship Council certified fishery in India for their sustainable clam fishing.[7]

The lake and the life on its shores have inspired many artists and writers. It has been the subject of many poems by the renowned poet Thirunalloor Karunakaran who was born and brought up on its banks.</p>
 
 <h2>Eight arms of Ashtamudi estuary</h2>
 <p> <h3>Kandachira Kayal</h3>
Kandachira Kayal serves as the southern arm of Ashtamudi Lake, connecting three panchayats: Panayam, Thrikadavoor, and Mangadu. According to data from the Panayam Village Office, the catchment area of Kandachira Kayal is approximately 20 hectares and 10 ares. The Kayal area extends to Kandachira, Panayam, Kadavoor, Thrikadavoor, Anchalumood, Thevalli, Ashramam, and reaches the southern side of the KSRTC bus stand in Kollam. [8] A significant quantity of municipal waste finds its way into the lake through the canal that traverses the southern and eastern regions of Kollam Town.

<h3>Kureepuzha Kayal</h3>
Kureepuzha Kayal of Ashtamudi Estuary is often likened to the "Loch Lomond" of Kerala due to its resemblance to Loch Lomond in Britain. It is the busiest kayal in the Ashtamudi estuarine system as it is part of the National Waterway and serves as the only route to Kollam town from Neendakara. The Kollam Corporation waste dumping yard is situated on the left bank of Kureepuzha Kayal (Mammoottilkadavu).

 <p><h3>History</h3>
A recent study on the late Quaternary evolution of the Ashtamudi-Sasthamkotta lake systems revealed that during the early Holocene period, Ashtamudi Lake had 12 creeks (Dhwadesamudi). Sasthamkotta Lake, Kerala's largest natural freshwater lake, which is now listed as a Ramsar site, was believed to have been part of Ashtamudi Lake approximately 10,000 years ago but became disconnected around 7,000 years ago. Currently, Sasthamkotta Lake has eight creeks (Ashtamudi). Two other creeks of the lake were disconnected during a similar process in the early Holocene period, namely Chittumala Lake and Cherupola Lake. During the disconnection period, the creek that later formed Sasthamcotta Lake had the upper estuary salinity of the then Ashtamudi Lake. It is estimated that it took at least 1,000 years for the disconnected water body to completely lose its salinity.[9]

Quilon or Kollam and inevitably Ashtamudi lake's importance is claimed to be dated to the days of the Romans and the Phoenicians. Ibn Batuta, during his 24-year sojourn in the 14th century, is reported to have mentioned about the Quilon port as one of the five ports for Chinese trade. Links with Persia (9th century), Chinese mandarin in 1275 AD, Portuguese in 1502 AD, and the Dutch followed British in 1795 AD are recorded history. Velu Thampi is credited with organizing the rebellion against the British from this place.[10] During the colonial era, the Dutch Naval Commander General D’ Lanoy is believed to have ordered the reclamation of part of Ashtamudi marshes on the southern flanks, particularly in Dalawapuram, for the plantation of coconut and other fruit trees. Subsequently, in the nineteenth century, the British expanded the expanse of Quilon by establishing an army garrison and extending markets in the area. Railway links were established with Thirunelveli in 1904 and with Trivandrum in 1918, as documented by Menon (1964). Furthermore, the establishment of roads and a railway link between Kollam and Ernakulam via Munroe Island in 1958 eventually led to the fragmentation of the Ashtamudi estuary into two parts, particularly isolating the Karali marshes.</p>
 <p> <h3>Access</h3>
 Considering Kollam as the entry city to the lake, access to the lake are to the Thiruvananthapuram International Airport, 71 km (44 mi) away and by road to almost all important centres in Kerala and the rest of the country. National Highway 47 (NH 47) passes through the lake periphery not only from Quilon but also to other locations on its bank from Thiruvananthapuram to the northern towns of Kerala. Southern Railways network of lines connects Quilon with all important centres in the rest of the country. Ferry services operate daily to Alleppey and boats operate to all villages located in the canals of the backwater system. The boat jetty is located at about 2 km (1.2 mi) away from the railway station.[6] Famous Paravur estuary and backwaters are just 21 kilometer away from Ashtamudi. National waterway 3 (Kollam - Kottappuram) starts from the south of Ashtamudi lake over a distance of 168 km. Among the seven terminals positioned along this waterway, Ashtamudi and Kollam are situated along the estuary. Regular boat services to Muthiraparamb, Guhanandapuram, Ayiramthengu, Munroe Island, and Alappuzha are available from the Kollam jetty.</p>
 <p><h2>Topography</h2>

Kallada River
Main article: Kallada River
Kallada River is a major river discharging into the Ashtamudi Lake. The Kallada river, which originates near Ponmudi from the Kulathupuzha hills Western Ghats is formed by the confluence of three rivers, viz., Kulathupuzha, Chenthurnipuzha, and Kalthuruthipuzha, and after traversing a distance of about 121 km (75 mi) through virgin forests finally debouches into the Ashtamudi wetland at Peringalam (Koivilai) located to the west of Munroe Island. The Kallada River has a length of 121 km and a catchment area of 1,699 sq. km. The annual run-off is estimated at 2,140.8 million meter3. The river's tributaries originate independently in the highlands at an altitude of 1,200 meters and converge at about 300 meters to form the Kallada River. The river reaches the coast at an altitude of 0-10 meters before emptying into Ashtamudi Lake. From the east, the estuary comprises eight arms: Thevally, Kureepuzha, Kandachira, Thekkumbhagam, Peruman, Kanjirottu, Kallada, and Kumbaluthu, giving it the name "Ashtamudi" which means "eight-coned." The estuary also encompasses four major islands: Munroturuttu, Thekkumbhagam, Trikkaruva, and Trikakkadavur. With a maximum depth of 21 ft (6.4 m) at the confluence, it is Kerala's deepest estuary.[11][12] Ashtamudi Estuary exhibits a shallow characteristic, with an average depth of 1.8 meters and a maximum depth of 9 meters. The central area of the estuary typically ranges in depth from 1 to 2 meters, featuring a deep, funnel-shaped depression along its eastern margins.

Ashtamudi Lake receives water from numerous minor streams draining from the south and east. It is connected to Paravur Kayal (Kollam Thodu) in the south and to Kayamkulam Kayal (Chavara - Panmana Thodu) in the north via canals. Other streams like manichithodu drains into the lake. The presence of several islands (known as thruths) indicates a high rate of siltation in the estuary.</p>
<p><h3>Neendakara</h3>
The mouth of the Ashtamudi Estuary has been developed into Neendakara Harbour, which serves over 3,000 marine fishing boats and trawlers. The harbour features breakwaters extending 610 meters seaward and 380 meters leeward, creating a sheltered basin and a navigable approach for the vessels.

Littoral drift, which involves the movement of sediments in near-shore zones by waves and currents, significantly influences the shaping and orientation of coastal landforms and the overall evolution of the coast. The Neendakara inlet serves as a confluence zone between the sea and the estuary. The tidal amplitude at this location reaches a maximum of 1.12 meters, with an average of 0.5 meters according to tide-forecast.com.

In natural conditions, high drift rates are likely to lead to the formation of shoals and bars at the mouth of the estuary, which may be periodically cut open by high-velocity river flows. With the reduction in inflows from the Kallada River, the mouth of the estuary requires periodic dredging to maintain sufficient depth for port operations.
<h3>
Islands in the lake</h3>

Munroe Island (Munroethuruth) is a cluster of eight tiny islands in Ashtamudi Lake.

Thekkumbhagom island, situated on the bank of the Ashtamudi Lake, provides the feel of rustic life of a village.[tone][citation needed] The significance of this village is because the first epic poetry in the Malayalam language, Ramachandravilasam, was composed by the poet Azhakath Padmanabha Kurup in this village. An ancient 1000-year-old temple and a 200-year-old church are located here.[</p>
<p><h3>Geology</h3>
Quaternary and Tertiary sediments and sedimentary rocks are the formations in the lake basin and environs. The Quaternary sediments are of marine and fluvial alluvium of recent age. Tertiary sediments comprise laterite, sandstones and clays of Warkalai formation.[3]

The tertiary Warkalli Formation and Quilon Formation are prominently exposed around the Ashtamudi Estuary. The Warkalli Formation consists of sandstone and clay with lignite intercalations, which overlay fossiliferous limestone and calcareous clay of the Quilon Formation. The latter formation is extensively exploited, contributing significantly to the region's mineral output. Kollam District is responsible for producing 36% of the state's crude clay and 43.5% of its processed clay, which collectively account for 9.08% of India's total China Clay production. The coastal side of the basin exposes the Guruvayur Formation from the quaternary period, characterized by a sand-silt-clay admixture of marine origin.

<h3>Hydrology</h3>

Astamudi Lake Near Veerabhadra Swami Temple
Ashtamudi Estuary remains an open system year-round, characterized by the absence of sandbar formations regardless of the season. Consequently, tidal action persists strongly throughout the year, extending even to the interior parts of the estuary. There is a net tidal exchange of 4968 m3. The average annual runoff from the river system into the estuary is reported to be 76 km3 of freshwater.[12] The basin drainage area is 1,700 km2 (660 mi2) and with an average annual rainfall of 2400 mm (94 in) it discharges 3.375 km3 (2,740,000 ac·ft) of flow annually. It acts as a flood storage lake thus protecting the thickly populated city of Quilon (Kollam) and the coastal land. The Thenmala Dam built across the Kallada river is 85.3 m high by 35 m long (280 ft by 115 ft) with a reservoir area of 23 km2 (8.9 mi2) with a storage volume of 0.505 km3 (409,000 ac·ft). Though it provides irrigation to 61630 ha for paddy and upland crops, it has aggravated the salinity ingress into the wetland and the river due to reduced outflows during summer months.[3] 88% of the inflow contributed by Kallada and 12% through rainfall. During peak monsoon, the inundation of the Ashtamudi Estuary reaches 5,700 hectares, with a maximum length of 10.6 km and a width of 8 km. This seasonal transition is a significant aspect of the wetland's ecological character, particularly influencing its ecological productivity. [13]

Ashtamudi is a brackish system, so the salinity values are high. It ranges between 13-33.5 ppt. The creek areas are normally remain fresh during the monsoon and post monsoon.

The commissioning of the Kallada Dam has resulted in a significant reduction in freshwater inflow into the estuary. This, coupled with decreasing rainfall and rising sea levels, has led to a increase in salinity levels. However, the decline in water quality within the estuary has been notable due to the continuous discharge of untreated waste from various sources, including Kollam City, tourist resorts, industrial units, slaughterhouses, and houseboats.

<h3>Climate</h3>
The estuary and its drainage basin are situated in a warm, humid tropical climate. The average annual rainfall amounts to 2251.57 mm, primarily received in two distinct spells of the south-west and north-east monsoons. Rainfall during the south-west monsoon constitutes the predominant component, contributing 48% of the total rainfall. Temperature typically ranges between 22-33°C. Evaporation rates peak during January (207 mm) and reach a minimum in July (89 mm). Relative humidity varies from 63% in January to 87% in June-July. Wind speeds range from 1.3 to 2.1 km/hour, with higher speeds observed during March-June and lower speeds during September-December.

<h3>Flora</h3>
Ashtamudi Estuary has mangroves Avicennia officinalis, Brugiera gymnorrhiza and Sonneratia caseolaris as also 43 species of marshy and mangrove associates including two endangered species Syzygium travancoricum (endangered species according to the Red Data Book of Indian Plants) and Calamus rotang in the Terrestrial system.[2] These species offer excellent scope for development of marine bioreserve to promote eco-tourism in the estuarine of the lake.[12] IUCN lists the two endangered species in IUCN 2008. The total number of Syzygium travancoricum is reported to be very small, not more than 200. The major threats to the endangered species are reportedly draining of the wet lands and conversion into paddy fields.[14] A total of 52 species of phytoplankton have been documented in the estuary, representing 35 families and 10 classes.</p>
<p><h3>Wildlife</h3>
The lake supports 57 species of avifauna, of which 6 are migratory and 51 resident species.[2] It is also reported that about 40 species of wetland-dependent birds are recorded in the lake, out of which 45% are long-distance migrants. Terns, plovers, cormorants, and herons are most abundant birds in the lake.[3] A study report has identified 45 insect species, including 26 species of butterfly, 5 odonates, 9 hymenopteras, and 2 orthopterans, 1 hemipteran and 2 coleopterans. About 29 zooplankton species have also been identified.[3] The water body is the habitat for phytoplankton from the genera Amphora, Borosigma, Cyclotella, Cymbella, Gyrozigma, Meloziva, Navicula and Nitzschi.[3] More than 20,000 waterfowl visit Ashtamudi Lake annually. Additionally, the lake serves as a nursery ground for commercially important shrimp species that are harvested off the Kollam coast.[19] The zooplankton fauna in Ashtamudi Lake primarily comprises Copepoda, fish larvae, Oligochaeta, fish eggs, Ostracoda, Polychaeta, Coelenterata, and Rotifer.

<h3>Fishes</h3>
The composition of the fish fauna in Ashtamudi Lake comprises a total of 87 species under 64 genera, belonging to 38 families within 14 orders. Among the recorded species, 8 are classified as highly commercial, 45 as commercial, 27 as minor commercial, and 7 have no fisheries interest.[20]

The taxonomic distribution of fish species in Ashtamudi Lake reveals the following order composition:

Perciformes: 46 species
Clupeiformes: 12 species
Mugiliformes: 6 species
Cypriniformes: 4 species
Siluriformes: 4 species
Pleuronectiformes: 3 species
Tetraodontiformes: 3 species
Beloniformes: 3 species
Scorpaeniformes: 1 species
Elopiformes: 1 species
Atheriniformes: 1 species
Cyprinidontiformes: 1 species
Gonorynchiformes: 1 species
Anguilliformes: 1 species
In terms of percentage distribution, Perciformes is the most dominant order, constituting 52.87% of the total fish species, followed by Clupeiformes (13.79%), Mugiliformes (6.89%), Cypriniformes and Siluriformes (4.59% each), Pleuronectiformes, Beloniformes, and Tetradontiformes (3.45% each), and the remaining orders each constituting 1.15% of the total fish species.

World Wildlife Fund (WWF) reports[citation needed]

97 species of fish (42 are typically marine, 3 estuarine, 9 estuarine-riverine, 15 marine-estuarine) and unique copepod species. It is also a congenial habitat for all species of penaeid and palaemonid Prawns, edible crabs, paphia malabarica (short neck Clams) and a variety of fish. A comparative shell morphology study of short-neck clam Paphia malabarica, the main clam fishery resources in the Ashtamudi Lake re-assigned to the genus Marcia recens (Venus Clams) and this study found it was wrongly identified as short-neck clam in previous studies.[21] Clams found in the estuary are exported.[2] The estuary is the source of livelihood for thousands of fishermen and is stated to be the second biggest fish-landing centre after the Vembanad estuary.[</p>

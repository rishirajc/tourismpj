    <h1 style={{backgroundColor:"lightgreen"}}>About Kerala Kalamandalam</h1>
    <p>Kerala Kalamandalam, a deemed-to-be-University of Art and Culture by the Government of India, is a major centre for learning Indian performing arts, especially those that developed in the country's southern states, with special emphasis on those from Kerala. The institution, on the banks of the Bharathapuzha river, is situated in the small town of Cheruthuruthi in Thrissur district.</p>
 <p>
    <p>The Kerala Kalamandalam is widely recognised as a centre of excellence in performing arts that spearheaded the cultural renaissance in Kerala in the 19th century. Located in Cheruthuruthy in Thrissur district, Kalamandalam has been considered to be the most prestigious school for Kathakali in the entire world for decades. 

It was established by Vallathol Narayana Menon in the year 1930 on the banks of the Nila River (Bharatapuzha). Apart from being a poet and scholar, Vallathol was also immensely passionate about Kathakali and other classical dance-theatre traditions of the state. It was when he realised that the interest in traditional performing arts was dwindling rapidly that he, with the support of Manakkulam Mukundaraj, a cultural activist and Kakkad Karanavappad, an eminent scholar, set out with this altruistic venture. Thus training in classical performing arts, which was until then exclusively accessible to landlords and provincial kings, was launched. 

Over the years Vallathol ensured that Kalamandalam helped Kathakali and Mohiniyattam flourish like never before. Many stalwarts like Pattikkaamtodi Ravunni Menon joined Kalamandalam at Vallathol’s invite and added to the fame of the institution.

Today the Kerala Kalamandalam is an officially deemed University for Art and Culture. The traditional Gurukula or residential system of education is followed here. Which means the bond between the teachers and students is like no other. The biggest asset that the Kalamandalam can boast of is the talented students and veteran teachers of the institution. 

Kathakali is not the only art form taught here. Kutiyattam, Mohiniyattam, Thullal, Nangiarkoothu, and different kinds of percussion instruments are also taught here. Students are also given training in vocal music as well. Body massage, physical exercises, recapitulation, repetition of the lessons taught and in depth training are all a part of the classes that start at 4.30am each day. The spaces in which classes are held are known as Kalaries. 

There are special introductory courses available for Kathakali, Kutiyattam, Mohiniyattam and the vocal and instrumental modes of classical music at Kalamandalam. This is apart from the crash courses that are available as well. Troupes from Kalamandalam have represented the nation in several international dance and theatre festivals through the years. Sponsors and patrons across the world have set up scholarships and awards for the students of Kalamandalam to aid the students in their journey toward learning.

The Kerala Kalamandalam offers a grounded, pure and simple environment in which the indigenous art forms can thrive. For a casual visitor the most interesting feature of the institution will most probably be the Koothambalam. 

Built in traditional architectural elegance, it is the first and only such Koothambalam to be constructed outside of a temple complex. Its granite pillars are renowned for having the one hundred and eight karanas (dance-poses) inscribed on them. The stage floor, pillars and roof structure are all made of teak wood and rose wood. 

The Vallathol Museum located on the campus is another attraction for visitors. The museum portrays the important points of Vallathol’s life and journey. The final resting place of Vallathol Narayana Menon, called the Vallathol Samadhi is also located here. </p>
    <h2>History</h2>
The inception of Kalamandalam gave a second life to three major classical performing arts of Kerala, bringing out Kathakali, Kudiyattam and Mohiniyattam from a state of near-extinction in the early 20th century.[2] Amidst its abyss, in 1927, poet Vallathol Narayana Menon and art-promoter Mukunda Raja came forward and formed a society called Kerala Kalamandalam. They solicited donations from the public and conducted a lottery in order to raise funds for this society.[3]

Kerala Kalamandalam was inaugurated in November 1930 at Kakkad house in Kunnamkulam, and was, six months later shifted to Ambalapuram near Mulakunnathukavu before eventually moved onto the village of Cheruthuruthy, just south of Shoranur, in 1936. The Maharaja of Cochin donated the land and a building. Subsequently, a dance department was started to revive Mohiniyattom.[4][5]

Kerala Kalamandalam has been functioning as a grant-in-aid institution under the Cultural Affairs Department, Government of Kerala. In 2006, the Kalamandalam was accorded the status of 'Deemed University for Art and Culture' by the Government of India. In 2010, University Grants Commission (India) has given 'A' category status for Kerala Kalamandalam. Kalamandalam is the only deemed university in Kerala state accorded the prestigious status.[6]</p>
<p> <h3>Visits by prime ministers</h3>
The first Prime Minister to visit Kerala Kalamandalam is Jawaharlal Nehru in 1955 for the Silver Jubilee of the Kerala Kalamandalam. Indira Gandhi was the second Prime Minister to visit Kerala Kalamandalam in 1980 and V. P. Singh in 1990. Manmohan Singh is the fourth Prime Minister to visit Kerala Kalamandalam in September 2012.[7][8]</p>
<p> <h3>Courses</h3>
Kalamandalam imparts training in classical dance and theatre forms like Kathakali, Mohiniyattam, Kudiyattam, Thullal, Kuchipudi, Bharatanatyam, and Nangiar Koothu, besides the traditional orchestra called Panchavadyam. Training is also given in various percussion instruments like chenda, maddalam and mizhavu. Kalamandalam follows the gurukula sampradayam, the ancient Indian education system based on residential tutelage. Kalamandalam was conceived to provide training to its students in the Gurukula Sampradaya, an ancient tradition of residential schooling where students stayed with the teachers. The first vice chancellor of kerala kalamandalam was K G Paulose (2007) and the last chairman of Kerala Kalamandalam was O.N.V.Kurup. Present vice chancellor is M V Narayanan.</p>

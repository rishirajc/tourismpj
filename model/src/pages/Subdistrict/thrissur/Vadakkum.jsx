    <h1 style={{backgroundColor:"lightgreen"}}>About Vadakkunnathan Temple</h1>
    <p>The Vadakkumnathan Temple is an ancient Hindu temple dedicated to Shiva in Thrissur, in the Thrissur district of Kerala, India. The temple is a classical example of the architectural style of Kerala and has one monumental tower on each of the four sides in addition to a koothambalam. Mural paintings depicting various scenes from the Mahabharata can be seen inside the temple.[1][2][3] The shrines and the Kuttambalam display vignettes carved in wood. The temple, along with the mural paintings, has been declared as a National Monument by India under the AMASR Act.[4] According to popular local lore, this is the first temple built by Parashurama, the sixth avatar of Vishnu. Thekkinkadu Maidan, encircling the Vadakkumnathan Temple, is the main venue of the renowned Thrissur Pooram festival.[1][2]

In 2012, the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) has recommended 14 sites, including Vadakkumnathan Temple and palaces, from Kerala to include in the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites.[5] The temple is also the first one among the 108 Shiva Temples in ancient Kerala, established by Parashurama, and is mentioned in the Shiva Temple Stotra as Shrimad-Dakshina Kailasam, meaning 'Mt. Kailash of the South'.</p>
   <p>The idol is not visible, as it is covered under 3-5 meter high and 5-7 meter wide mount of ghee, formed by daily abisheka (ablution) with ghee over centuries.

In spite of high temperature, ghee does not melt, no insects & the collection is preserved as good as new even after centuries. It is believed that lord Siva (Kiratha) had a head injury during his fight with Arjuna and lordDhannuandhara moorthy (Lord of Auyurveda) prescribed ghee ablution.

Outside this nalambalam the temple theater, known as "Kootthambalam" is situated. Exquisite vignette carved in wood, beautiful wooden pillars, acoustic treatments - this is an engineering marvel has no parallel anywhere else in the world. There was practice followed by carpenters to keep a small chisel at the most important place of the structure It is predictive that there is something wrong or the urgent maintenance is due if the chisel falls down. And the chisel fell down during the year 1875 AD and Mr. Vellinezy Jatadevan Nampoothiri remodified this in 1880. More than 410 Sq.m. built area, this is biggest of this kind. The 41 day special program of "Koothu" (mythological story telling) and "Koodiyattom" (ancient form of dramatic dance) is performed here annually.

Mural Painting of dancing lord Siva with 16 hands is an amazing work of Madhurangattu Namboodiri. The fifteen hands are holding different armaments and last is holding a flag post with flag. While one leg is pressing the embodiment of papa (Apasmaramoorthi) and the other one is in elevated form. The moment the last touch (Opening the Eyes) was over the picture started to dance - according to a legend. Another mural is the Vasuki Shayanam (Siva). (exactly like Ananthasayanam where lord Vishnu rests on Ananatha) The sculpture of large bullock (Nandikeswara) which is also there in thenalambalam. These are worshiped regularly along with sapthamathrukkal (seven goddesses)

<h4>Some Interesting Rituals</h4>

Before concluding day pooram, the deities ascending through southern gopuram will travel up to the statue of erstwhile Maharaja of Cochin in front of the Corporation office. There was a custom a team of merchants from market will receive the deities from the swaraj round and will lead to the market. This "Angadi Kanikkura" was a way of seeking the blessing. To commemorate this custom is followed. Version is also that "Nairangadi" was residential area once and the dietis travel to "prayeduppu".

Nilapadu thara: In front of eastern gopuram of vadakkumnathan some 10 meters towards north there is an elevated place which is called "niladthara". Earlier the representatives of Cochin dynasty used sit here and watch the pooram. Now it turned the finishing point of the pooram.

Vadakumnathan Temple, some Popular Legends


Vadakumnathan is one of the 108 Sivalayas consecrated by Saint Parasurama. Since Devi Parvathy was alongside Siva when he gave darsan to the saint, Parvathy was also installed facing east in the temple. Lord Vigneswara and Lord Sreerama were also added to complete the installation.

The mode of dharsan for this temple was formatted by the saint Adi Sankara, who in turn was a born to his parents for their Tapsya at this temple. This dharsan order is still followed without alternations.

Arjuna's Villkuzhi: During the Mahabharata war Jayadra was killed by Arjuna to retaliate his son Abhimanyu's heroic death trapped in "chakra view-ha". Jayadra was an ardent devotee of Lord Siva and hence the arrow that killed him fell in to the Vadakumnathan temple courtyard. As per Sree Krishna's advice, Arjuna prayed to lord Siva and was condoned of his sin for killing Jayadra. A deep well was formed where the arrow fell and legend says that Arjuna cleaned his arrow with the water from this well. It is customary to wash your feet with water from this well before starting dharsan in this temple. Few meters away from this villkuzhi, towards north there are two granite pillars. Samorin of Calicut paid an offering "gold thulabharam" to Vadakumnathan .To perform this offering (articles weighed against one's own weight) this giant pillars were made.

Gosalakrishna: Saint Villuamangalam who has having a close rapport with all deities, once noticed a hallo on the northern side of the temple, which then slowly turned into a cowherd and cows. The saint felt the presence of lord Krishna and as per Villuamangalam direction the Gosalakrishna temple was built.

The Hrishba temple: is located on north-west side of the northern entrance. Carved out of fine granite stone the idol is a bullock in sleeping posture. Earlier, the bullock was in standing position and was worshipped from the front side (east). One morning the idol was found lying and later front door was closed and instead side view was opened. Since the idol is a sleeping deity, the Hrishaba should be worshipped after waking him up by clapping your hands. A piece of thread from your dhoti is to be presented as an offering to the God to cover up his nakedness. There is a school of thought that the idol is of "Digambra" of Jainisam. After completing his duties Saint Parasurama disappeared at the north east corner of the temple (eesana cone - north-east corner), where you will see a small area earmarked with walls and lightened with a lamp. The kings, the arch enemies of the saint, used avoid this holy place hence the nearby bypass.

Simhodara Temple: Next to the eastern pathway connecting the east gopuram lies "Simhodara" temple. Simhodara is the trusted lieutenant of lord Siva and is guarding the main Siva temple, by watching the "thazikakudom" (There is a hole - triangle in shape - in the main wall, through which you can have the dharsan of the temple's "Thazhikakudam"). The real name of this deity is "Sarvaka" who was a student of wrestling to Nandikeswara (the holy bullock). During the trail the central part of the body of sarvaka was elongated and the name simhodara (belly of lion). Lord Siva agreed to be in Kerala as per the request of saint Parasurama and Sarvaka was deputed to find a suitable place. Sarvaka travelled all over and found all are suitable places. He was tired from the journey and was taking rest when Lord Siva came along with Devi. He kicked Sarvaka to the present place (kadikuzhi- the drainage).

An ardent devotee of Vadakumnathan used to pray for a humble request to have dharsan of Kasi Viswanatha. As per the recommendations from Sree Parvathy, lord made a direct tunnel to Kasi and invited the devotee to travel along with. The moment they touched Kasi, Sree Parvathy requested Simhodara to close the tunnel (you will see a balikallu here to mark the spot). It is believed Sree Parvathy had a second thought that Ganga may use this tunnel. The devotees are advised to put a stone as a helping hand to the closure. However this practice was banned as per a devaprasana, recently.

Sambuthara: This is the platform at south east corner where you salute Lord Chidhambara by facing east and Lord Rameshwara by facing south. Lord Siva used to dance as "Nadaraja" (King of Dance) in Chidambaram which is reflected in Rameswaram as well. As per Nandikeswara's (the holy bullock) advice, Anantha, the 1001 headed Serpent king watched the shadow - sitting on this platform - of this dance and was blessed to notice the same at the entrance of the sanctum sanatorium of Vadakunnathan temple as "Nirtha Nathan".

Amma thara: Here we salute "Oorakathamma" and "Sree Koodalmanikyaswamy (Sree Bharatha)". A part of the holy spirit of Sreekamakshi accompanied the ardent devotee Thiruvalayannur Bhattathiri (Poomulli Namboothiri) to stay near Sree Parvathy at Vadakunnathan premises. Yielding to the prayers of Bhattathiri, Kamakshi was allowed to settle at Oorakam, which is located at around 10 KM southwards, as Oorkathamma. Similarly the idol of lord Bharatha was to be installed adjacent to Sreerama temple. But as per the humble prayers of Vakayil Kaimal the idol was installed at Irinjalakuda, 20 km southwards of Vadakunnathan. It is believed that every day both Sreevparvathy and Sreerama pay a visit to this Ammathara to see their sister & brother respectively.

Kali sila: Kali sila, the small stone kept within the walls of the temple, is gradually growing in terms of height and when it reaches the height of the western gopuram, the Kaliyugam ends. To prevent this devotees throw the balance of the Sivaprasad on it.

On "Thrikarthika" day, Sri Villuamangalam found Lord Siva sitting on the compound wall adjacent to the southern gopuram. The almighty was enjoying "Karthika vilakku" of Kumaranellor. Till then one pooja to lord Siva is done here on Karthika day.

Main shrine: While entering the main shrine, just behind the Nandi and on the northern wall is a rare mural painting. It is "Vasuki sayana". Vasuki is the serpent king and the garland of lord Siva. Here lord Siva is lying on Vasuki (as Lord Vishnu on Anantha).

Lord Sankaranarayana is also called Madhyanathan (Lord of center - may be because it is in the center of Rama & Siva temple). As per the rule we have to pay dharsan 4 times to both Siva and Rama temple. But to Sankaranarayana it is 6 times. There is no practice to give any type of prasadam from this shrine.

However Lord Sankaranarayana is the custodian of all movable and immovable assets of Vadakunnathan temple.

Temple: The newly wed couples - Sree Rama & Seetha - was blocked on their way to Ayodhya from Midhila by Parasurama. Sree Rama defeated Parasurama and the saint donated all his powers to Sree Rama. Sreerama was travelling by the chariot given by lord Sun, so devotees pay respect to soorya (sun) at the south side of the temple. Devotees pay respect to Nrsimha portrait on the wall.

Ganapathy Temple (Venmadakoil): Vadakkumnathan had 12 day utsavam during "Uthrayana" season and discontinued due to various reasons. Once the coffer was empty and the "Yogadirippad" had an oracle to remove the Ganapathy idol. A dark room (nilavara) was found below the peetam and a golden lizard lightening the whole place. The room was full of gold and jewels. The chieftain took only whatever needed to conduct utlsavam. You will see a stone carving of the lizard to commemorate this.(behind the left door to the main entrance of the Valiyambalam). Touch and pray for the prosperity here. There is a mural painting near the sopanam of the Lord Siva temple. It is the "sundra yakshi" (Beautiful apsara). If you touch and pray on this portrait, this charming young lady will marry you.

Northern Gopuram: On close observation you may find that the Northern gopuram of Vadakumnathan Temple is slightly leaning. There is a legend behind this too. Once upon a time, a small golden serpent was found in a bell of the Namaskaramandapa of Vadakumnathan and Karrat Namboodhiri tried to pull it down to win a bet. The tail of the serpent started growing beyond the temple pushing away the Namboodhiri. Finally Karrat found asylum in the pond (kokarni - near to north gopuram). Chasing serpent covered the pond and the Namboodhiri had no choice but to beg for help from "Garuda". When Garuda came and took position on the northern gopuram, the serpent (who was actually Vasuki) vanished. The gopuram could not carry Garuda's weight and started to lean and the king of birds flew away.

Eastern Gopuram: The chief priest of Vadakumnathan used to do some secret pooja after daily routine in a room in this gopuram. It is rumored to be black magic and as per Maharaja's order an employee peeped through a hole in the door to verify this. It was just "Bhagavathy Seva" and during the climax of the pooja, employee saw an amazing power source, which as per the legend blinded him. The room remained closed for decades.

Southern Gopuram: Southern Gopuram is a donation from King of Kodugallore and hence devotees pay their salute to Kodugallore Devi here. To pass through this gopuram is said to be a journey of no return. In olden days, the convicts, who were sentenced to death, were brought to Sankaranarayana Temple for their last rites. They were made to wear red garlands and would later be handed over to "Arachar" waiting outside the southern gopuram. The sentence was performed at a place called Anchery, some 6km south east of Vadakumnathan. However the doors of this gopuram are now opened only for Thrissur pooram. "Neithilkavilamma" a participant pooram deity opens this door from outside on the day before pooram and will be closed the Thrissur pooram day after the royal dharbhar "Thekkottirakkam".

Western Gopuram: The western gopuram was constructed by the Perumppadappu Swaroopam of Cochin dynasty. The "deepasthambham" was donated by Samoothiri of Calicut as a token of compromise between Perumppadappu and Calicut.</p>
   <p> <h3>Legend</h3>
Legends regarding the origins of the Vadakkumnathan Temple are briefly narrated in the Brahmanda Purana and these legends are referenced in some other works as well.[6] Though these accounts differ with respect to certain details, they are all in agreement regarding the central theme that the temple was founded by Parashurama. According to lore, Parashurama requested the Lord of oceans Varuna to bring forth a new piece of land from the waters. Varuna complied and the land created became Kerala.

Parashurama now wanted to consecrate this new land. So he went to Mount Kailasa to his guru, the god Shiva and requested him to take abode in Kerala and thereby bless the region. Shiva accompanied by his wife Parvati, his sons Ganesha and Subrahmanya and his routinue went along with Parashurama, to oblige his disciple. Shiva stopped at a spot, which is now Thrissur, for his seat. Later he and his party disappeared and Parashurama saw a bright and radiant Lingam (non-anthropomorphic icon of Shiva) at the foot of a huge banyan tree. This place where Shiva manifested his presence as a lingam is known in Sanskrit as the Sri Moola Sthana.


The Sri Mula Sthana - the original site of the linga, before it was moved to the current temple.
For sometime, the lingam remained at Sri Moola Sthana at the foot of a huge banyan tree. The ruler of Cochin Kingdom then decided to shift the lingam to a more appropriate place and construct a temple around it. Arrangements were soon made for the new installation. But there was an initial difficulty. The lingam could not be removed without cutting off a large part of the banyan tree. This created the risk of damaging the lingam due to falling branches. As the ruler remained confounded, the Yogatirippadu came forward with a solution. He lay over the lingam so as to cover it completely with his body and asked the men to cut the tree. The cutting began and to everyone's astonishment, not a single branch of the tree fell anywhere near the deity. The deity was moved according to prescribed rituals and installed in the new place where it remains to this day. Subsequently, a temple was built around the deity, according to the rules specified in the Shastras. [7</p>
<h3>History
</h3>
<p>The temple was built at the time of Perumthachan from Parayi petta panthirukulam.[10] It is said that Perumthachan lived during the second century; so the Koothambalam may be more than 1,600 years old. According to Malayalam historian V. V. K. Valath, the temple was a pre-Dravidian Kavu (shrine). In the early days, Paramekkavu Bhagavathi shrine was also situated inside the Vadakkunnathan temple. Subsequently, a new temple was built outside and the idol of the goddess was moved to that location. For comparison, Koodalmanikyam Temple, Kodungallur Bhagavathy Temple and Ammathiruvadi Temple, Urakam are older than the Vadakkunnathan temple, according to temple documents.[11] Some suggest that there have also been influences from Buddhist and Jain temples</p>
<h3>Yogiatiripppads</h3>
<p>The Nambudiris who were entrusted with looking after temple affairs were called Yogiatiripppads. When Nambudiris gained control of the region, the temple also came under their domain. The Yogiatiripppads were elected from Thrissur desam. Prior to Sakthan Thampuran's reign, the Yogiatiripppad system declined. Later, the Maharaja of Cochin gained presiding authority over the temple.</p>
<h3>Adi Shankara</h3>
<p>Adi Shankara is believed to have been born (509 BC) to Shivaguru and Aryamba of Kalady consequent to their prayers to Lord Vadakkumnathan, as amsavatara of Shiva. The couple devoutly prayed for 41 days at the temple. Legend has it that Shiva appeared to the couple in their dreams and offered them a choice. They could have either a mediocre son who would live a long life or an extraordinary son who would die early. Both Shivaguru and Aryamba chose the latter. In honour of Shiva, they named their son Shankara.[12][13] According to legend, Adi Shankara attained videha mukti ("freedom from embodiment") at the Vadakkunnathan temple. One narrative as expounded by the Keraliya Shankaravijaya, identifies the temple as his place of death.[14] He also established four Mutts at Thrissur, famously known as Edayil Madhom, Naduvil Madhom, Thekke Madhom and Vadakke Madhom</p>
<p> <h3>Invasion of Tipu Sultan</h3>
During the invasion of Tipu Sultan, the temple was not attacked by Tipu's Army.[15] Even though Tipu Sultan destroyed many temples in Thrissur district at that time, he never touched Vadakkumnathan Temple. According to historical accounts, when Tipu Sultan was marching towards the Travancore lines, known locally as Nedumkotta, he had a short stay at Thrissur city from 14 to 29 December 1789. In order to feed his Army, he had borrowed cooking vessels from Vadakkumnathan Temple. Before leaving Thrissur city, he not only returned the vessels, but presented the temple with a large bronze lamp.[16]

<h3>Zamorin of Calicut</h3>
During 1750 to 1762, the temple affairs were conducted by Zamorin of Calicut who attacked Thrissur and took control of the temple and the city. In 1762 with the help of Kingdom of Travancore, Maharaja of Cochin regained control over Thrissur and the temple.

<h3>Sakthan Thampuran</h3>
When Sakthan Thampuran, ascended the throne of Kingdom of Cochin, he changed the capital of Kingdom of Cochin from Thripunithura to Thrissur as the King had a personal relationship with Vadakkumnathan Temple. He later cleared the teak forest around the temple and introduced the famous Thrissur Pooram festival. The King's personal interest in the temple also changed the fortune of the city.</p>
<p> <h3>Architecture</h3>
The temple is situated on an elevated hillock in the centre of Thrissur City and is surrounded by a stone wall enclosing an area of nearly 9 acres (36,000 m2). Inside this fortification, there are four gopurams facing four cardinal directions. Between the inner temple and the outer walls, there is a spacious compound, the entrance to which is through gopurams. Of these, the gopurams on the south and north are not open to the public. The public enter either through the east or west gopuram. The inner temple is separated from the outer temple by a broad circular granite wall enclosing a broad corridor called Chuttambalam. Entrance into the inner temple is through a passage through the corridor.</p>
<h3>Deities</h3>
<p>In the northern side, the main sanctum is a circular structure with main deity of the temple Shiva facing west and behind him, his consort Parvati facing east, denoting their combined form Ardhanarishvara. Shiva, is worshipped in the sanctum as a 16-foot-high (4.9 m) lingam, which is covered entirely by a mound of ghee, formed by the daily abhishekam (ablution) with ghee over the years. The lingam is embellished with thirteen cascading crescents of gold and three serpent hoods on top. According to traditional belief, the ghee-covered lingam represents the snow-clad Mount Kailash, the abode of Shiva. This is the only temple where the lingam is not visible.[citation needed] It is said that the ghee offered here for centuries does not have any foul odour and it does not melt even during summer. But even then, it breaks in parts during some periods. Such periods are considered to be beneficial or harmful depending upon the part and area of the breaking.

Located on the verandah of the Nalambalam is a large white bull Nandikeswara, Shiva's vehicle. The two-storied rectangular shrine of the god Rama facing west is located in the south. Between these two sanctums (srikovils) stands a third one, circular and double-storied in shape, which is dedicated to Shankaranarayana, the combined form of Shiva and Vishnu, facing west. There are mukhamandapams (halls) in front of all the three central shrines.[17] It is said that Hanuman resides in the mandapam in front of Rama's sanctum.

The two important murals - which are more than 350 years old - in the temple, Vasukisayana (reclining Shiva) and Nrithanatha (20-armed Nataraja), are worshipped daily.[18] The temple also houses a museum of ancient wall paintings, wood carvings and art pieces of ancient times.[18]

Ganesha shrine is positioned facing the temple kitchen. The offering of Appam (sweetened rice cake fried in ghee) to him is one of the most important offerings at the temple. Propitiating him here is believed to be a path to prosperity and wealth.

In the outer temple, there are shrines for Krishna (Gosala Krishna or Gopala Krishna; Krishna as a cowherd), Nandikeswara, Parashurama, Simhodara (Shiva's gana), Ayyappa (Shiva and Vishnu's son, especially venerated in Kerala), Vettekkaran (Shiva as a hunter), Serpent deities and Adi Shankara. Also, there are places here to worship Kashi Vishwanatha, Nataraja, Ramanathaswamy, Goddess Bhadrakali (of Kodungallur Temple), Bharata (of the Koodalmanikyam Temple) and Goddess Durga (of Ammathiruvadi Temple).

Outside the main temple, there are shrines for the two sons of Shiva and Parvati - Subrahmanya (Kartikeya) and Ganapathi (Ganesha). Both these temples are of much recent origin, having built only in 1940's. Both are located beneath two giant banyan trees, namely Manikantan Aal and Naduvil Aal. The Subrahmanya Temple under Manikantan Aal, which is located at the south-western side of Vadakkumnathan Temple, was built by some local devotees who were furious by the continuous speeches of political leaders during Indian Independence Movement happening under Manikantan Aal. The idol here represents Lord Subrahmanya with his two consorts - Valli and Devasena, sitting over a peacock. He is installed facing east. Palabhishekam (Pouring milk over the idol) and Panchamrutham are the main offerings of the temple. Thaipooyam is the main festival here. Along that, Shashti days important for Lord Subrahmanya. The Ganapathi temple under Naduvil Aal, located exactly to the west of Vadakkumnathan Temple, is actually just a small setup, without any sanctum or other traditional temple features. The main deity, Lord Ganapathi, is installed facing west, in a mode of welcoming those entering the city from the western side. Vinayaka Chathurthi is the main festival in the temple.</p>

<h3>Koothambalam</h3>
<p>The temple theatre, known as Koothambalam, has four magnificent gateways called Gopurams and the lofty masonry wall around the temple quadrangle are imposing pieces of craftsmanship and skill. The Koothambalam is used for staging Koothu, Nangyar Koothu and Koodiyattam, an ancient ritualistic art forms of Central Kerala. According to folk lore, before the new Koothambalam was built, there used to be an old and dilapidated structure. Then Diwan T. Sankunni Menon ordered to demolish the structure and construct a new Koothambalam. He gave this task to Velanezhy Nambudiri, a famous Thachushasthranjan or master craftsman, who built the structure. Velanezhy Illom is in Venganellur Gramam, Chelakkara town.</p>

<h2>Festivals</h2>
<h3>Maha Shivaratri</h3>
<p>Maha Shivaratri is the main festival which is celebrated in the temple.[19] Cultural and musical programmes are held in the temple premises. Around one lakh temple lamps are lighted in the festival. On this day, there is the continuous abhishekam on the lingam with ghee and tender coconut. The temple is not closed in the night, and there will be special poojas with abhishekam on the day</p>
<p> <h3>Aanayoottu</h3>
The Aanayoottu of feeding of elephants, is the second biggest festival held in the temple. The devotees refer to elephants as the elephant-headed god Ganesha's incarnation. The festival falls on the first day of the month of Karkkidakam of the Malayalam calendar (July). It has been the regular annual practice at the temple for the last 20 years to conduct a large-scale Ashta Dravya Maha Ganapathy Havana and Aanayoottu on the first day of the Karkidakom month of the Malayalam calendar. It involves a number of unadorned elephants being positioned amid a multitude of people for being worshipped and fed. A large number of people throng the temple to feed the elephants.Gajapooja also is conducted once every four years.</p>

It is a 36 long hour festival which attracts thousands of devotees and tourists. The main attractions of Pooram are Madathilavaravu panchavadhyam, Elanjithara melam, Kudamattam and Vedikettu.</p>

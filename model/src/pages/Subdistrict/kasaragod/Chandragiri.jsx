    <h1 style={{backgroundColor:"lightgreen"}}>About Chandragiri Fort</h1>
    <p>Built in the 17th century by Shivappa Nayak of Bedanoor, the Chandragiri Fort belongs to the chain of forts built by the same ruler. The fort is ten kilometers away from Bekal. The eventful history of the fort goes like this. The river Chandragiri was earlier considered to be the border of the two powerful kingdoms – Kolathunadu and Thulunadu. When Thulunadu was captured by the Vijayanagara Empire, the Kolathunadu kings lost the Chandragiri region to them. During the decline of the Vijayanagara Empire the area was administratively looked after by the Keladi Nayakas of Ikkeri. In 16th century the Vijayanagara Empire fell and Vengappa Nayaka declared independence. Later Shivappa Nayak took over the reins. He built a chain of forts of which Chandragiri is part. This large fort is 150 feet above sea level and offers an astonishing view of the Chandragiri River and the Arabian Sea.</p>
    <p>Chandragiri Fort (Malayalam: ചന്ദ്രഗിരിക്കോട്ട ) is a fort built in the 17th century, situated in Kasaragod District of Kerala, India. This large squarish fort is 150 feet (46 m) above sea level and occupies an area of about seven acres[1] the adjacent to Chandragiri river. The fort is now in ruins</p>
   <h3 style={{backgroundColor:"lightgreen"}}>Geography</h3>
<p>Chandragiri Fort was built in the confluence of the Arabian Sea and the Chandragiri River, also known as the Payaswini river.[2] The fort is located about 59 kilometers south of Mangalore and 87 kilometers north of Kannur.</p>
<h3 style={{backgroundColor:"lightgreen"}}>History</h3>
<p>From time immemorial Kasaragod has been well-known to the world outside. But very few studies and researches are done regarding the history of Kasaragod. That few studies hail the diversity of this place. Being an important trade centre the place has lured travellers from different parts of the world especially the Arabs and Europeans. The pamphlets and descriptions written by these adventurous travellers about the cultural and economic diversity of Kasaragod are the only sources available to us. Between the 9th and 14th centuries the place was visited by many Arab travellers. The Arabs who frequented this place called it by the name Harkiwilla. 

In 1514 the Portuguese traveller Duarte Barbosa visited Kumbla, a place near Kasargod. The records made by this famous traveller stand testimony to the fact that rice was exported to Maldives from here. 

In his travelogue, written during the visit to kasaragod in 1800, Dr. Francis Buchanan, the family doctor of Arthur Wellesley, recorded information on places like Athiraparambu, Kavvai, Nileshwaram, Bekal, Chandragiri and Manjeshwaram.

The political history of Kasaragod starts with the Tuluva kingdom. The Northernmost parts of Kasaragod District were once within the territory of the Tuluva kingdom. The central and southern parts were under the rule of Chirakkal (Mushika or Kolathiri) Royal Family of North Kerala.

Bits and glimpses of the past are available to us in the form of stories and legends. Local legends of Kasaragod say that there were 32 Malayalam and 32 Tulu villages in this region.
Kasaragod, for a long time, was part of the domain of the Kolathiri family. Even when the region was attacked by the Vijayanagara Empire it was under the rule of the Kolathiri Raja. Nileshwaram was one of his capitals. Popular belief is that the characters appearing in the ritualistic folk dance of Theyyam represent those who helped king Kolathiri fight against the attack of Vijayanagara Empire.

By the 14th century the Vijayanagara Empire started declining. With the Battle of Talikota in 1565 the mighty Vijayanagara Empire disintegrated and the power was shifted to the hands of several feudatory chieftains. Many of them including the Keladi Nayakas (Ikkeri Nayakas) rose in political prominence. The Nayakas realized the political and economic importance of Tulunadu (which is the region comprising modern-day Udupi and Dakshina Kannada districts along with the Northernmost part of Kasaragod District ) and attacked and annexed the region. Thus the power of administration was shifted to the hands of Ikkeri Nayakas. During this time Bekal became the center in establishing the dominance of the Nayakas in Malabar. Consequently the Nayakas realized the economic importance of the port town and there came a need to fortify the dominion from all kinds of attack. The Bekal port was strengthened with this aim. The construction was initiated by Hiriya Venkatappa Nayaka and it was completed during the period of Shivappa Nayaka. The work was done at great speed. It was also aimed at the defence of the fort from overseas attack. It also helped them in strengthening their attack on Malabar. The same period witnessed the construction of yet another famous fort called the Chandragiri fort near Kasargod.

Though there are many versions of history regarding the construction of the Bekal fort it is believed that Shivappa Nayaka of Ikkeri dynasty built this fort. He took up the rule in 1645 and transferred the capital to Bednoor. The shift to Bednoor had given them another name – Bednoor Naiks. Both Chandragiri fort and Bekkal fort are considered to be part of a chain of forts constructed by Shivappa Nayaka for the defence of the kingdom. Another version ascribes the construction of the fort to Kolathiri Rajas from whom it was captured by Sivappa Nayaka.

In 1763, Hyder Ali, the ruler of the kingdom of Mysore, conquered Bednoor.  This included several ports of Malabar. Hyder Ali used these ports to establish a small navy.  His intent was to capture the entire Kerala. His efforts to capture the Thalassey fort were not successful. Soon after this defeat Hyder Ali returned to Mysore and died there in 1782. He was followed by his son Tipu Sultan who continued the attack and conquered Malabar. As per the Sreerangapattanam treaty of 1792, Tippu surrendered Malabar except Tulunadu (Canara) to the British. The British had to wait till the death of Tipu to lay hands on this unique place. Finally in 1799 Tipu Sultan was killed in the fourth Mysore war and the British could capture Canara.

On April 16, 1882 Bekal taluk was included in the Madras presidency and thus Kasargod taluk came into existence. A resolution was moved by Vengayil Kunhiraman Nayanar in 1913 on the floor of Madras Governor's Council demanding the merger of Kasargod taluk with the Malabar district. The resolution was withdrawn due to the strong opposition from the members from Karnataka. But the same demand was stressed once again in 1927 during a political convention held at Kozhikode. The convention passed a resolution demanding the same.

The same year witnessed the birth of an organisation titled Malayalee Seva Sangham. The great efforts raised by eminent personalities like K.P.Keshava Menon finally found fruition in the merging of Kasaragod with Kerala following the reorganisation of states and formation of Kerala in November 1, 1956.

The Etymology of the place – Facts and Legends
There are ever so many interpretations and views on the derivation of the name Kasaragod. Legends and other oral stories throw light on these interpretations. Popular among them is the view that it is the combination of two Sanskrit words kaasaara (which means lake or pond) and kroda (which means a place where treasure is kept). Kasaragod is also a place where the kasaraka trees (Strychnos nux vomica or Kaanjiram or Kaaraskara) grow in abundance. Perhaps Kasaragod could have inherited the name from these trees. The large number of lakes and ponds in the coastal belt of the district and the thick flora consisting of innumerable varieties of trees and shrubs especially the kasaraka trees validate both interpretations.</p>
<p>The Chandragiri River marked the boundary between the Tulanadu and the Kolathanadu Kingdoms.[2] Both kingdoms would eventually be conquered by the Vijaynagara Empire, and the region came under their control.[2][3] Upon the fall of the Vijaynagara Empire, the Keladi Nayakas, who had administered the region for the Vijaynagara Empire, declared independence and took control of many regions of Uttara Kannada, including the area the fort would later be built.[2][3]

Chandragiri Fort was built in the 17th century by Shivappa Nayak, alongside a chain of other fortresses.[3] As of today, the fort is managed by the Kerala State Department of Archaeology, with assistance from the Department of Tourism. The Department of Archeology conducted an excavation and uncovered cannonballs made of stone and iron, iron tools, and pottery.</p>
<h3 style={{backgroundColor:"lightgreen"}}>Layout</h3>
<p>The found boundary area is approximately 7.76 acres, while the building is roughly 5 acres and of a square shape.[4][5] The fort is 46 meters (150) feet above sea level, and composed of laterite bricks. Some of the walls were damaged by cannon fire.[2] A trench surrounds the fort from three directions. On the Eastern and Western direction, both have entrances leading into the trench. On the North-Eastern corner, an underground tunnel is also visible.[4]

The fort contains 8 bastions, each with cannon (peeranky) holes. The main bastion is located on the North. Other buildings, such as barracks, are also within the fort.[4</p>
<h3 style={{backgroundColor:"lightgreen"}}>Languages</h3>
<p>As far as language is concerned Kasaragod occupies a unique position in the map of Kerala. There are as many as seven languages used actively by a considerable number of people in Kasaragod. Though the administrative language is Malayalam, Tulu, Beary bashe, Kannada, Marathi and Konkani are also spoken. Furthermore there are ever so many dialects and tribal languages that augment the cultural resplendence of Kasaragod. The version of Malayalam spoken here varies a lot from the standard Malayalam and is generally considered difficult for the people from southern Kerala. It is often referred to as Kasrod Malayalam. Unlike the other Dravidian languages it shows little influence of the Sanskrit language. Studies in this idiom have been useful in knowing the nature of evolution of the South Indian languages.

Extensive usage of 'ny' sound, lack of or loss of Approximant consonants, presence of sound 'b' instead of 'v' are some of the salient features of Kasaragod Malayalam. In Kasaragod Malayalam words often end with aa whereas in standard Malayalam it ends with o. Generally pronouns are used during direct conversation.

Compared to the standard Malayalam the Kasaragod Malayalam is very spontaneous and natural-sounding. The time taken to complete a sentence in Kasaragod Malayalam is nearly half that taken to complete the same sentence in the South Kerala dialect of Malayalam. Kasaragod Malayalam is deeply influenced and contains words from Tulu, Kannada, Arabic, Hindi, Tamil, etc. It has an advanced vocabulary that provides single word substitutes for expressions that are unavailable in standard Malayalam. The language is rapidly evolving and adds new words to it frequently.

<h3 style={{backgroundColor:"lightgreen"}}>Tulu Nadu</h3>
<p>Tulu Nadu, the land of tulu speaking people spreads over to parts of present Karnataka and Kerala. This region consists of the Dakshina Kannada and Udupi districts of Karnataka and the northern parts of the Kasaragod district of Kerala up to Chandragiri River.

Tuluva, the ethnic group adds up to the majority of the population in this region. The Tuluvas are mostly concentrated in the coastal areas. Konkanis who migrated from Goa, the smallest state in India are the next major ethnic group here.

Tulu Nadu sprawls over an area of 8,441 km2 (3,259 sq mi) and is bounded on the west by the Arabian Sea and on the east by the Western Ghats.Tulu Nadu has a tropical climate and it experiences heavy rainfalls during the Monsoon season. 

Historically, Tulu Nadu consisted of two separate lands of Haiva and Tuluva, the two ethnic groups. This region was under the reign of Ballal Kings of Sullia. It is believed that the Bunt/ Nair and the Brahmin migration to Tulunadu might have happened during the lifetime of the Kadamba king Mayuravarma at 345 AD. During the reign of Madhvacharya in the 13th century, around eight monasteries (Mutts) were built in Udupi.

Tulunad was the original homeland of the dynasty that established the Vijayanagar Empire based in eastern Karnataka. Until the 17th century Tulu Nadu was governed by feudatories of the Vijayanagara Empire. The longest reigning dynasty of Tulu Nadu was the Alupas and they were the feudatories of the prominent dynasties of Karnataka.

Over the centuries, more ethnic groups migrated to Tulu Nadu. In this, the Konkanis and Goud Saraswat Brahmins were the major groups who arrived by the sea. In the 16th century after the arrival of Catholics to Tulu Nadu from Goa, various developmental changes occured as they built excellent educational institutions which contributed to the development of education in the region. The Muslim community of Tulu Nadu was basically Arab traders who married local women and settled there.

After the British defeated Tipu Sultan in 1799, Tulu Nadu was attached to the Madras Presidency before being reverted to the state of Mysore. It was then named as Karnataka. Later the states were reorganized on linguistic basis in the 1956 and Kasargod became part of the newly formed Kerala state.

Art Forms
The Yakshagana, a night-long dance and drama performance practiced in Tulu Nadu is a popular art form with great fanfare. Yakshagana is a typical south Indian folk dance form said to have originated around 400 years ago in Karnataka state of India. It is similar to Kathakali of Kerala and has a strong classical background.

The performance comprises of dance, music and spoken words with the themes based on Hindu epics like Mahabharatha and Ramayana. The costumes of the Yakshagana artistes are very attractive and different.

Language
Spoken by over three million people, Tulu is a Dravidian language of India. Most of its speakers are native to the districts of Dakshina Kannada and Udupi in the west of the state of Karnataka and Kasargod district of northern Kerala. Other major languages in the area are Kannada and Konkani. The Tulu speakers are known as Tuluvas. The Tulu script is also known as the Tigalari script and it has resemblance with Malayalam script.

Economy
Tulu Nadu once depended on agriculture and fishing. The major crops grown in this region were rice, bengal gram, horse gram, vegetables and fruits. Plantation crops like coconut, areca nut, cocoa, cashew nut, and pepper are also grown. Tulu Nadu contributes the second highest revenue to Karnataka state after the city of Bangalore. This region has an international airport at Mangalore which is well connected to the rest of India and Middle Eastern countries. New Mangalore port (NMPT) is one of the major ports of India and located at Panambur, Mangalore.

Education
Tulu Nadu is one of the most prominent Educational centers on the western coast of India. There are more than hundred professional colleges in Tulu Nadu which represents the standard of education in this region. There are more than thousands of students from all over India and abroad studying in these institutions. 

Linguists have suggested that the word Tulu literally means water. In Tamil tuli means drop of water, and tulli means the same in Malayalam. Hence Tulu means the language of the waters. Tulu-speaking people can be found in the coastal region of modern Karnataka and parts of Northern Kerala.

As per the Malayalam works like Keralolpathi and Sangam literature in Tamil, this region stretched from the Chandragiri river, now part of the Kasaragod district of Kerala, to Gokarna, now part of Karnataka state. The cities of Mangalore, Udupi and Kasaragod are the cultural centres of Tulu culture.

During World War I, a large number of Tulu speaking people migrated from undivided South Canara district to other provinces (regions). The next set of emigration was during World War II and this time they settled in interior parts of Karnataka and coastal areas of Andhra Pradesh. Even today Tulu is widely spoken in the Dakshina Kannada, Udupi district and Uttara Kannada districts of Karnataka state and Kasaragod of Kerala. Efforts are also being made to include Tulu in the list of official languages of India.

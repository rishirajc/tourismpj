    <p>Ranipuram (also known by its former name Madathumala) is a village and a major tourist attraction in the Kasaragod district of the Indian state of Kerala. It is located near Talakaveri Wildlife Sanctuary in Kerala-Karnataka border. Situated at 1,048 metres (3,438 ft) above mean sea level, Ranipuram is 48 km from the nearest city Kanhangad and 107 km from the major port city of Mangalore.</p>
   <p>Tucked away from the clamour of city life, in Kasaragod district lies a sanctuary of tranquility known as Ranipuram Hills. This verdant paradise is located 750m above sea level and is often touted as the ‘Ooty of Kerala’.  While on one side of this lush green haven lies Karnataka, on the other side is the picturesque landscape of Kerala. 

Considered to be a trekker’s paradise, Ranipuram comprises grass savannahs, evergreen Shola forests and monsoon forests. The sprawling meadows, wildflowers and moors all together make for an unforgettable ambiance. Even the breeze here is believed by many to have medicinal value owing to the lemongrass that grows abundantly in the area. A biodiversity hotspot, the entire area is home to a wide variety of flora and fauna. Some of the animals sighted commonly here include leopards, deer, wild dogs, wild boars, elephants, Malabar Giant Squirrels and jungle cats. A wide range of reptiles including the King Cobra, green whip snake and monitor lizards can also be found here. Another interesting aspect of these hills apart from the rare species of butterflies that pirouette around is the plethora of bird species found here like the Paradise flying catcher, green barbet, peacock, trogon, wood pigeon, malabar grey hornbill, white bellied tree pie and the Great Indian hornbill.

Earlier known as Madathumala, the expansive forests here merge with the famous Coorg mountains of Karnataka. The Ranipuram trek generally begins from Panathady right in the morning. There are cottages available here where you can arrange for accommodation. At the end of your 2km trek through the forest vegetation you will emerge into extensive shola grasslands that stretch out far out into the horizon. It is indeed a sight to see the grass in these picturesque meadows dance to the breeze. Sightings of wild elephant herds are commonplace here. 

A place that boasts of some of the best trekking trails, regular Jeep and bus services are available from Panathady and Kanhangad in Kasaragod Town to these hills. The Ranipuram Hills are the highest point in the district and the panoramic views from atop these hills are astounding.</p>

<h3 style={{backgroundColor:"lightgreen"}}>History</h3>
<p>From time immemorial Kasaragod has been well-known to the world outside. But very few studies and researches are done regarding the history of Kasaragod. That few studies hail the diversity of this place. Being an important trade centre the place has lured travellers from different parts of the world especially the Arabs and Europeans. The pamphlets and descriptions written by these adventurous travellers about the cultural and economic diversity of Kasaragod are the only sources available to us. Between the 9th and 14th centuries the place was visited by many Arab travellers. The Arabs who frequented this place called it by the name Harkiwilla. 

In 1514 the Portuguese traveller Duarte Barbosa visited Kumbla, a place near Kasargod. The records made by this famous traveller stand testimony to the fact that rice was exported to Maldives from here. 

In his travelogue, written during the visit to kasaragod in 1800, Dr. Francis Buchanan, the family doctor of Arthur Wellesley, recorded information on places like Athiraparambu, Kavvai, Nileshwaram, Bekal, Chandragiri and Manjeshwaram.

The political history of Kasaragod starts with the Tuluva kingdom. The Northernmost parts of Kasaragod District were once within the territory of the Tuluva kingdom. The central and southern parts were under the rule of Chirakkal (Mushika or Kolathiri) Royal Family of North Kerala.

Bits and glimpses of the past are available to us in the form of stories and legends. Local legends of Kasaragod say that there were 32 Malayalam and 32 Tulu villages in this region.
Kasaragod, for a long time, was part of the domain of the Kolathiri family. Even when the region was attacked by the Vijayanagara Empire it was under the rule of the Kolathiri Raja. Nileshwaram was one of his capitals. Popular belief is that the characters appearing in the ritualistic folk dance of Theyyam represent those who helped king Kolathiri fight against the attack of Vijayanagara Empire.

By the 14th century the Vijayanagara Empire started declining. With the Battle of Talikota in 1565 the mighty Vijayanagara Empire disintegrated and the power was shifted to the hands of several feudatory chieftains. Many of them including the Keladi Nayakas (Ikkeri Nayakas) rose in political prominence. The Nayakas realized the political and economic importance of Tulunadu (which is the region comprising modern-day Udupi and Dakshina Kannada districts along with the Northernmost part of Kasaragod District ) and attacked and annexed the region. Thus the power of administration was shifted to the hands of Ikkeri Nayakas. During this time Bekal became the center in establishing the dominance of the Nayakas in Malabar. Consequently the Nayakas realized the economic importance of the port town and there came a need to fortify the dominion from all kinds of attack. The Bekal port was strengthened with this aim. The construction was initiated by Hiriya Venkatappa Nayaka and it was completed during the period of Shivappa Nayaka. The work was done at great speed. It was also aimed at the defence of the fort from overseas attack. It also helped them in strengthening their attack on Malabar. The same period witnessed the construction of yet another famous fort called the Chandragiri fort near Kasargod.

Though there are many versions of history regarding the construction of the Bekal fort it is believed that Shivappa Nayaka of Ikkeri dynasty built this fort. He took up the rule in 1645 and transferred the capital to Bednoor. The shift to Bednoor had given them another name – Bednoor Naiks. Both Chandragiri fort and Bekkal fort are considered to be part of a chain of forts constructed by Shivappa Nayaka for the defence of the kingdom. Another version ascribes the construction of the fort to Kolathiri Rajas from whom it was captured by Sivappa Nayaka.

In 1763, Hyder Ali, the ruler of the kingdom of Mysore, conquered Bednoor.  This included several ports of Malabar. Hyder Ali used these ports to establish a small navy.  His intent was to capture the entire Kerala. His efforts to capture the Thalassey fort were not successful. Soon after this defeat Hyder Ali returned to Mysore and died there in 1782. He was followed by his son Tipu Sultan who continued the attack and conquered Malabar. As per the Sreerangapattanam treaty of 1792, Tippu surrendered Malabar except Tulunadu (Canara) to the British. The British had to wait till the death of Tipu to lay hands on this unique place. Finally in 1799 Tipu Sultan was killed in the fourth Mysore war and the British could capture Canara.

On April 16, 1882 Bekal taluk was included in the Madras presidency and thus Kasargod taluk came into existence. A resolution was moved by Vengayil Kunhiraman Nayanar in 1913 on the floor of Madras Governor's Council demanding the merger of Kasargod taluk with the Malabar district. The resolution was withdrawn due to the strong opposition from the members from Karnataka. But the same demand was stressed once again in 1927 during a political convention held at Kozhikode. The convention passed a resolution demanding the same.

The same year witnessed the birth of an organisation titled Malayalee Seva Sangham. The great efforts raised by eminent personalities like K.P.Keshava Menon finally found fruition in the merging of Kasaragod with Kerala following the reorganisation of states and formation of Kerala in November 1, 1956.

The Etymology of the place – Facts and Legends
There are ever so many interpretations and views on the derivation of the name Kasaragod. Legends and other oral stories throw light on these interpretations. Popular among them is the view that it is the combination of two Sanskrit words kaasaara (which means lake or pond) and kroda (which means a place where treasure is kept). Kasaragod is also a place where the kasaraka trees (Strychnos nux vomica or Kaanjiram or Kaaraskara) grow in abundance. Perhaps Kasaragod could have inherited the name from these trees. The large number of lakes and ponds in the coastal belt of the district and the thick flora consisting of innumerable varieties of trees and shrubs especially the kasaraka trees validate both interpretations.</p>

<h3 style={{backgroundColor:"lightgreen"}}>Geographic and Demographic Details</h3>
<p>To its south is the Kannur District renowned for its ritual arts like Theyyam. Dakshina Kannada district of Karnataka known for its Yakshagana dance forms the northern boundary.  The mighty Western Ghats forms a wall along the eastern side. The western side is eternally caressed by the supple hands of Arabian Sea. Covering an area of 1992 km² the district is home to 1,203,342 people (according to 2001 census). There are two taluks in Kasaragod, namely Kasaragod and Hosdurg, and both are municipalities. Seventy-five villages and thirty-nine panchayats make this district which is further subdivided into six administrative segments called development blocks. These six development blocks are Manjeshwar, Kasaragod, Kanhangad, Nileshwar, Parappa and Karadukkal. Just like the thirteen other states of Kerala Kasaragod also has a high literacy rate.

According to the 2001 census, Kasaragod had a population of 12, 03342. Males constitute 49% of the population and females 51%. The average literacy rate of Kasaragod is 79%, which is higher than the national average of 59.5%: male literacy is 82%, and female literacy is 76%.</p>
<h3 style={{backgroundColor:"lightgreen"}}>Languages</h3>
<p>As far as language is concerned Kasaragod occupies a unique position in the map of Kerala. There are as many as seven languages used actively by a considerable number of people in Kasaragod. Though the administrative language is Malayalam, Tulu, Beary bashe, Kannada, Marathi and Konkani are also spoken. Furthermore there are ever so many dialects and tribal languages that augment the cultural resplendence of Kasaragod. The version of Malayalam spoken here varies a lot from the standard Malayalam and is generally considered difficult for the people from southern Kerala. It is often referred to as Kasrod Malayalam. Unlike the other Dravidian languages it shows little influence of the Sanskrit language. Studies in this idiom have been useful in knowing the nature of evolution of the South Indian languages.

Extensive usage of 'ny' sound, lack of or loss of Approximant consonants, presence of sound 'b' instead of 'v' are some of the salient features of Kasaragod Malayalam. In Kasaragod Malayalam words often end with aa whereas in standard Malayalam it ends with o. Generally pronouns are used during direct conversation.

Compared to the standard Malayalam the Kasaragod Malayalam is very spontaneous and natural-sounding. The time taken to complete a sentence in Kasaragod Malayalam is nearly half that taken to complete the same sentence in the South Kerala dialect of Malayalam. Kasaragod Malayalam is deeply influenced and contains words from Tulu, Kannada, Arabic, Hindi, Tamil, etc. It has an advanced vocabulary that provides single word substitutes for expressions that are unavailable in standard Malayalam. The language is rapidly evolving and adds new words to it frequently.</p>
<h3 style={{backgroundColor:"lightgreen"}}>Central Plantation Crops and Research Institute</h3>
<p>Established in the year 1970 by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research, the Central Plantation Crops and Research Institute (CPCRI), serves as a national forum for improving the genetic potential of plantation crops, to produce genetically superior planting materials for coconut, arecanut, spices and cashew. It was in 1916 that a coconut research station was established in Kasaragod by the Government of Madras. Subsequently it was taken over by the Indian Central Coconut Committee in 1948 and continued till 1970. The Central Plantation Crops Research Institute (CPCRI) was established in 1970 as one of the agricultural research institutes under the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), by merging Central Coconut Research Station, Kasaragod, Central Coconut Research Station, Kayamkulam as well as CentralArecanut Research Station, Vittal and its five substations at Palode and Kannara (Kerala), Hirehalli (Karnataka), Mohitnagar (West Bengal) and Kahikuchi (Assam).

The main priorities of the institute are the research and frontline aspects of coconut, areca nut, and cocoa. These are carried under five divisions viz, crop improvement, crop production, crop protection, physiology, biochemistry and post harvest technology and social sciences. The Institute has three Regional Stations – Kayamkulam (Kerala), Vittal (Karnataka) and Minicoy (Lakshadweep) and three Research Centres – Kahikuchi (Assam), Mohitnagar (West Bengal) and Kidu (Karnataka). The institute is equipped with well established research farms, well equipped laboratories at Headquarters, Regional Stations and Research Centres, besides a Library cum Documentation Centre at headquarters and Regional Stations. The Extension Section, Agricultural Technology Information Centre and Krishi Vigyan Kendras are the means by which the transfer of technology is facilitated.

The CPCRI has released five coconut hybrids, eight high yielding coconut varieties, five high yielding Areca nut varieties, one Cocoa variety and four Cocoa hybrids to the farming community through its extensive research activities for commercial cultivation.</p>

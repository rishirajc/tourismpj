    <h1 style={{backgroundColor:"lightgreen"}}>About Houseboats</h1>
  <p>Have you ever gone cruising in a houseboat on the backwaters of Kerala? If you haven't, make sure you do. This is easily one amongst the most remarkable and unique experiences that our state has to offer. 

Present day houseboats are huge, slow moving exotic barges used for leisure trips, and are in fact a reworked version of the Kettuvallams of olden times. The original Kettuvallams were used to carry tons of rice and spices. A standard Kettuvallam can hold up to 30 tons of goods from Kuttanad to the Kochi port.

In Malayalam language Kettu refers to ‘dwelling structures’ ‘Vallam’ means boat. These are boats with a thatched roof cover over wooden hulls. The boat is made of planks of jack-wood joined together with coir. This is then coated with a caustic black resin made from boiled cashew kernels. With careful maintenance, a Kettuvallam can last for generations.

A portion of the Kettuvallam was covered with bamboo and coir to serve as a restroom and kitchen for the crew. Meals were cooked onboard and supplemented with freshly cooked fish from the backwaters.

When  modern trucks replaced this system of transport, people came up with a new way that would keep these boats, almost all of which were more than 100 years old, in the market. By constructing special rooms to accommodate travellers, these boats cruised forward from near-extinction to enjoy their present  popularity.

Today these are a familiar sight on the backwaters and in Alappuzha alone, there are as many as 500 houseboats.

While converting kettuvallams into houseboats, care is taken to use only natural products. Bamboo mats, sticks and wood of the areca nut tree are used for roofing, coir mats and wooden planks for the flooring and wood of coconut trees and coir for beds. Nowadays, Solar panels are preferred for lighting.

Today, the houseboats boast of the same comforts of a good hotel including furnished bedrooms, modern toilets, cozy living rooms, a kitchen and even a balcony for angling. Parts of the curved roof of wood or plaited palm leaves open out to provide shade and allow uninterrupted views. While most boats are poled by local oarsmen, some are powered by a 40 HP engine. Boat-trains - formed by joining two or more houseboats together are also used by large groups of sightseers.

What is truly magical about a houseboat ride is the breathtaking view of the untouched and otherwise inaccessible rural Kerala that it offers, while you float in a relaxed way right through it.

Houseboats:
House boats are available at Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam, Kottayam, Allappuzha, Ernakulam, Thrissur and Kasaragod. Please contact DTPCs for more info.

For booking houseboats, travelers can make use of the House Boat Pre-paid Counter 'Trusted Service, Trusted Rates' managed by the District Tourism Promotion Council (DTPC).</p>

<p>A houseboat is a boat that has been designed or modified to be used primarily for regular dwelling. Most houseboats are not motorized, as they are usually moored or kept stationary, fixed at a berth, and often tethered to land to provide utilities. However, many are capable of operation under their own power.

Houseboats are largely found on small inland rivers, lakes, and streams, and in coastal harbours, especially where there is good fishing,[1] in many countries</p>

<h2>Africa</h2>
<p><h3>South Africa</h3>
There are a few houseboat options in South Africa, including self-drive houseboats on the Knysna Lagoon and fully catered houseboats on Lake Jozini. There have been a number of serious incidents with houseboat fires in the country. On 19 November 2016, four people died on Hartbeespoort Dam after a fire broke on a party houseboat. On 9 October 2021, a faulty engine set luxury houseboat Shayamanzi afire and led to the death of two crew members and a German tourist.[2][3]

<h3>Zambia</h3>
In Zambia, specifically on Lake Kariba, houseboats have been around and in use since the creation of the lake in the late 1950s to early 1960s.</p>

<h2>Asia</h2>
<p><h3>Bangladesh</h3>

A tourist houseboat in Tanguar Haor, Bangladesh
Houseboats have become more popular as a tourist attraction due to the number of houseboats plying at Tanguar Haor.[4] There is a large, slow-moving houseboat used for leisure trips. This service is inspired by the houseboat used by India's famed author Rabindranath Tagore during his visit to Shilaidaha. It is about 71 feet (22 m) long and about 14 feet (4.3 m) wide at the middle,[5] and has been in service since 2021.

<h3>Hong Kong</h3>
There is a houseboat and fishing community on the southern side of Hong Kong Island, known as Aberdeen Floating Village. There was also one such community in the Yau Ma Tei Typhoon Shelter.

<h3>India</h3>
In India, houseboats used as accommodation for tourists are common on the backwaters of Kerala and also on Dal Lake near Srinagar in Jammu and Kashmir (see below).

<h3>Kerala houseboats</h3>
Main article: Kettuvallam

A Kettuvallam at Kavvayi Backwaters, Nileshwaram, Kasaragod, India
Houseboats in Kerala, south India, are huge, slow-moving barges used for leisure trips. They are a reworked model of Kettuvallams (in the Malayalam language, Kettu means "tied with ropes", and vallam means "boat"), which, in earlier times, were used to carry rice and spices from Kuttanad to the Kochi port. Kerala houseboats were considered a convenient means of transportation. First Modern House Boat In Kerala developed by Thomas Vargheese in Kottayam in the time of Dr. Babu Paul IAS. The popularity of Kettuvallams has returned as major tourist attractions.

These houseboats are about 60 to 70 feet (18 to 21 m) long and about 15 feet (4.6 m) wide at the middle. The hull is made of wooden planks, usually of aanjili, held together by ropes of coconut fiber. The roof is made of bamboo poles and palm leaves. The boat exterior is painted with protective coats of cashew nut oil.

<h3>Kashmir houseboats</h3>

Unlike their counterparts in Kerala, the houseboats in Srinagar in Jammu and Kashmir — the northernmost state of India — are usually stationary, generally moored at the edges of Dal Lake and Nageen Lake. Some houseboats there were built in the early 1900s and are still being rented out to tourists. These houseboats are made of wood and usually have intricately carved wood paneling. They are of different sizes, some having up to three bedrooms apart from a living room and kitchen.

<h3>Indonesia</h3>

In Indonesia, a floating house is called as rumah apung. An example of a floating house in Indonesia is called rumah rakit (Indonesian: raft house), which is a type of traditional house found in riverine realm of South Sumatra, which is thought to have existed since the time of the Srivijaya kingdom. Raft houses are built on rafts and float along the banks of the Musi River, Ogan River and Komering River. To avoid the raft drifting away, the raft house is tied to a serdang (tether).[6][7]

<h3>Laos</h3>
In Laos, houseboats are used to accommodate tourists on the Mekong River. Usually referred to as "slow boats", the houseboats exist in wooden or steel variants.</p>
<h2>Europe</h2>
<p><h3>Germany</h3>

Houseboats on Landwehrkanal, Berlin, Germany
The Port of Hamburg has a sizable water-borne community that includes a Flussschifferkirche, or Boatman's Church. Berlin also has some houseboat neighborhoods, notably on the Landwehrkanal in Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg.

<h3>Netherlands</h3>

Houseboat in Amsterdam, Netherlands
In Europe, some of the finest and costliest examples of houseboats can be seen along the canals of Amsterdam, which even have houseboat hotels. Houseboats are very expensive in Amsterdam because of the limited number of moorings. This expense has reduced the likelihood that the approximately 2,400 families that live on the inner waters of Amsterdam will find themselves confronted by new neighboring boats. The bloemenmarkt is a houseboat-borne flower market along the Singel in Amsterdam. The town of Maasbommel is pioneering floating houses, with flexible connections for fluids and electricity, intended not primarily for travel, but rather safety against flooding.[10][11][12]

Amsterdam has what may be the world's only houseboat museum, located on a renovated cargo ship built in 1914 and opened by its current owners to the public in order to answer questions people often have about life on houseboats.[13]

<h3>Poland</h3>
Poland is the world's second largest producer of motor yachts, up to 9 meters in length after the United States. Poland has extensive experience in the production of modern and stylish houseboat yachts and floating houses.[14] Houseboat recreation is practicing in the Masuria District and on the Vistula River and lakes close to the Baltic seaside.

According to Zegluj.pl, the largest houseboat rental service in Poland, there are about 100 new units for charter every year.[15]

<h3>Serbia</h3>

Houseboats on Ada Ciganlija, Belgrade, Serbia
Houseboats are popular for recreation, dining and clubbing in Serbia. They can be seen in large numbers in Belgrade on the banks of the Danube and Sava Rivers, and on river islands.

<h3>United Kingdom</h3>
For narrowboats, highly-decorated historic houseboats popular across the English canal system, see Narrowboat.

In the United Kingdom, houseboats come under various authorities depending on where they are moored. Those that usually do not move from year to year and are in marinas come under local authorities. Those moored on tidal waters (estuaries and coastal harbours) come under various authorities.[citation needed] Most navigable inland waterways in England and Wales come under the authority of either the waterways managed by Environment Agency (EA, sponsored by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs) or the waterways managed by the Canal and River Trust (CRT). Scotland, Northern Ireland and some additional waterways in England and Wales have their own authorities (see the List of navigation authorities in the United Kingdom).

Both the EA and the CRT distinguish between powered vessels (including sail) and unpowered houseboats. The EA defines Launches as "any mechanically propelled vessel not being used solely as a tug or for the carriage of goods", and houseboats that "includes any pleasure boat which is not a launch and which is decked or otherwise structurally covered in and which is or is capable of being used as a place of habitation".[16] The CRT, which manages 2,000 miles of inland waterways,[17] requires any houseboat moored on their waterways to have a houseboat certificate. The CRT defines a houseboat as "'a boat whose main use is for a purpose other than navigation and which, if needed for the purpose, has planning permission, for the site where it is moored'. A houseboat may be used for navigation from time to time provided it does not become its main use".[18]

The CRT definition provides a large grey area about what a houseboat is, because owners of a narrowboat, or other inhabitable vessels (see list of the types of canal craft in the United Kingdom) who live on board may choose to define their boat either as a cruising vessel and pay for a cruising licence, or obtain a houseboat certificate. The decision often depends on which is cheapest and whether the CRT, or the local authority overseeing a marina's planning permission, allows moorings to be residential (meeting the local authority's requirements allowing permanent residence aboard at the mooring), or leisure (inhabitability only for short periods).[1</p>

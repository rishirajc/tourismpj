    <h1 style={{backgroundColor:"lightgreen"}}>About Kappad</h1>
    <p>Kappad, or Kappakadavu locally, is a beach and village near Koyilandy, in the Kozhikode district, Kerala, India.A stone monument installed by government commemorates the "landing" by Vasco da Gama with the inscription, 'Vasco da Gama landed here, Kappakadavu, in the year 1498'.

In 2007 a Rs. 1.5 crore program to beautify the beach was launched by [Kerala] Tourism Minister Kodiyeri Balakrishnan. It is now completed and Kappad beach has a corniche and park. The park includes a restroom, restaurant and seating.[2]

The nearest major railway station is Koyilandy, about 10 km away from Kappad. The nearest airport is Calicut International Airport (CCJ), which is about 25 km from the town of Kozhikode. Private transport buses are available from the main bus stand, or visitors can reach the beach by stopping at Thiruvangoor on National Highway 66 between Kozhikode and Vadakara. It is a Blue Flag beach.</p>
    <p>Kappad beach, a tranquil setting for a relaxed getaway, is located about 16 kms from Kozhikode town.

A plaque set on a pillar here says that it was at this beach that the Portuguese navigator Vasco da Gama landed on May 27, 1498.  This was presumably his first visit to Kerala. However, many historians believe that though he anchored his ship here, he had landed at the nearby port, Panthalayani Kollam. The place has its own historical relevance since it is said that the spice route flourished from this beach. 

The beach, which has only occasional visitors, is quiet except when the fishermen launch their boats at dawn and in the evening when they return with their catch. 

Other interesting sights here include a rocky headland that stretches into the sea, and a 100-year-old temple.  

Nearby Tourist Areas 

The Korapuzha estuary at Elathur, on the way to Kappad, is a little known tourist area. Village artisans crafting canoes along the river bank is an interesting sight here. The area around the nearby Elathur Bridge is a centre for shellfish (kallummakkaya) trade.</p>

<p> <h3>History of Kappad Beach</h3>
The southern state of Kerala has a long coastline stretching over 500 km and is home to quite a number of magnificent beaches. Some of these beaches have historical significance too. An example is the Kappad beach in Calicut. It was on this legendary beach that the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama first set foot on Indian soil in 1498 and changed the history of Kerala forever.

Vasco da Gama’s historic journey opened the sea route to other European nations and the vast wealth of the Malabar region. When Vasco da Gama landed in Kozhikode (Calicut), the Zamorins were the rulers of this region and supported him in his trading ventures in spices and textiles. Aside from opening up the spice trade route, it unfortunately also paved the way for colonization by some Western nations.</p>

<p>The Kappad Beach is also known as Kappakkadavu locally and lies about 16km away from Calicut. The beach is famous for its long stretches of silvery sands and scenic sunsets and is popular among tourists and indigenes alike. There is a paved walkway here where you can enjoy breezy evenings and the salty spray of the Arabian Sea. Watching the sea foaming and crashing against the rocks strewn around the northern end of the beach provides its own mesmerizing moments and is a favorite hangout spot for the city folks. There are some shacks located nearby which offer local delicacies and the ever-ready cup of ‘chai’ too.

This rocky beach even has a stone monument erected here declaring that Vasco da Gama landed here with his 170 men in three ships on the 27th of May 1498. This and the historical significance and magnificence of the beach are enough to attract tourists here in their droves. Though it’s usually deserted in the daytime, it’s quite crowded in the evenings. Another attraction located here is the 800-years-old temple known as the Kurumba temple or Orupottum Kavu. This is an important place of worship for the fishermen community.

Though the tsunami of 2004 affected this legendary beach, it was soon renovated again considering its historical significance. This has also resulted in permanent seats being erected along with the planting of trees to provide shade, further enhancing the beach’s appeal.

Calicut is the ideal place to settle down in Kerala as it is amply endowed with natural beauty, great infrastructure, and rich cultural heritage. With premier education institutions, big business houses and ample job opportunities, there is something here for everyone. Malabar Developers have a number of world-class residential projects here, offering a delectable home for the most discerning of customers.</p>

<p>Kappad beach is a historically significant coastal spot located near Kozhikode City.

After a lengthy arduous voyage to find a sea route to India, Vasco Da Gama, finally landed at Kappad in 1498.

To the Portuguese explorer’s delight, his group of 170 sailors was well received by the local ruler, the Zamorin of Calicut.

Well, all this and the rest of it, is history. Tumultuous history indeed. 

Gama’s landing at the beach of Kappad encouraged subsequent visits by other European powers of that time. Further along the path, India became a British colony till it gained freedom in 1947. This single event was so forceful to alter the historic course of the entire Indian subcontinent as well as significantly influence that of Europe.

The historic moment is commemorated by a monument erected on the beach. The inscriptions read: Vasco Da Gama landed here, Kappakadavu, in the year 1498. Kapppakadavu, by the way, is the local name for Kappad beach Kozhikode.</p>
<p>The depth of the ocean here made landing possible for sailors. And today, the same depth is our concern as visitors.

The beach, during high tide, is about 30 meters wide. During low tide, water recedes a further 50 meters. 

It means that, during low tides, the floor may be deceptively deep. That makes this beach less than ideal swimming spot, especially for the inexperienced.</p>

<p>If in doubt, check with locals, before taking a leap.


Kappad coastal strip portrays typical features of most other Kerala beaches- white sands, coconut greenery, beach side fishing village and wooden fishing boats resting on white sand.</p>

<p>What sets Kappad apart in looks are the shore line rocks. An expansive rock projects in to the sea. Mighty enough that it even holds an ancient Hindu Temple. The deity of this 800 year old rock top shrine is Devi, the female Goddess.

Many beachgoers find the Temple interesting enough to visit. Devotion leads some others to the zenith.</p>

<p>The beach quiet during daytime, gets small crowds of visitors, during evenings. The beach area remains generally clean primarily because it is not so crowded.

This beach is attractive to those who want a few days of plain idling. Many limit their Kappad beach holiday to an evening or to a day maximum due to the absence of sufficient engaging activities.

<h3>Backwater trips</h3>

Any disappointment about swimming at the beach can be well compensated by taking a backwater trip through the adjacent Korappuzha River. A canoe ride enjoying the unhurried rhythm of North Keralan life, set in the beautiful background of coconut palms and paddy fields, has a liberating feel to it.

For those who greatly enthused about North Kerala backwater, extended boat rides can be combined with Kappad beach holidays. The nearby Elathur Canal, Canoli Canal and Kallai River together form the backwater system of Kozhikode.



Also, a great option to reach the beach is a boat ride through Korappuzha River.

<h3>Facilities</h3>

Kappad has several shops and eateries. Kappad Beach Resort just overlooking the beach is the main place that provides accommodation here.

 <h3>How to reach</h3>

Kappad is connected to the nearby city of Kozhikode by frequent bus services.

Get on to bus at Kozhikode Municipal Bus Stand (New Stand) for the 16 kilometres ride.

If you are driving, take Kozhikode-Kannur road (NH 17). Turn left at Thiruvangoor and proceed till you reach the beach of Kappad.</p>

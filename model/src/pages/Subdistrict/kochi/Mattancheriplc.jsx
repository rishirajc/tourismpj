    <p>The Mattancherry Palace is a palace popularly known as the Dutch Palace, in Mattancherry, Kochi, in the Indian state of Kerala which features Kerala murals depicting portraits and exhibits of the Rajas of Kochi. The palace was included in the tentative list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites.[2] Despite the name Dutch Palace, the palace was built by the Portuguese Empire as a gift to the Kingdom of Cochin.</p>
  <p>
    <p>A palace constructed by the Portuguese, known in the name of the Dutch and used only by the rulers of Kochi, the Mattancherry Dutch Palace in Fort Kochi has an interesting past. It is one of the most visited places in the city and is located around 12km from Ernakulam city. 

Built around 1545 C.E. by the Portuguese as a present to King Veera Kerala Verma of the Kochi dynasty, the Mattancherry Palace is also well renowned as the Dutch Palace for it was the Dutch who later did renovations to the structure. A brilliant example of how the traditional Kerala style of architecture was affected by the colonial influences, this palace was used by the rulers of Kochi to conduct official ceremonies like coronations and so on.

The palace has been modelled on the traditional naalukettu (quadrangular) style of construction and has four different wings that open out onto the central courtyard. The ceilings of the large, spacious halls are embellished with floral designs carved in wood. Among the carvings one that stands apart as one of peculiar interest is that of the inverse lotus. The ceilings have also been decorated with brass cups. The floor that has been done with a blend of lime, plant juices, burnt coconut shells and egg whites can easily be mistaken for black marble and is a fascinating piece of artwork in itself. 

The central courtyard of the palace houses the royal deity, Pazhayannur Bhagavathi while the two other temples that are positioned on either side of the palace are dedicated to Lord Shiva and Lord Krishna respectively. The ground floor of the palace is where the ladies room, with a staircase to the kanithalam room, is located. The royal bed chamber, dining hall, assembly hall, square shaped coronation hall and the staircase room are all situated upstairs. 

The life sized statues of Kochi kings who ruled from the year 1864 stand proudly adorned in their coronation robes in the coronation hall of the palace. There are also Dutch maps of ancient Kochi, royal umbrellas made of silk and brass, the ceremonial royal sword, royal palanquins with floral designs, silver sequined gowns and other such exquisite objects on display in the palace. Daggers, spears and sheathed swords are some of the weapons found here. 

Another of the highlights here is the intricate murals that adorn the palace. These murals in the royal bed chamber covering about 100 square meters portray the entire story of Ramayana. It is believed that these paintings were done between the 17th and 18th century. On the staircase walls are mural paintings of Hindu gods and goddesses. Paintings that tell the story of Kumarasambhavam by the great writer Kalidasa adorn the walls of the royal ladies room. Five other panels that portray the Krishna Leela and Shiv Leela can also be seen here. 

The legacy of Mattancherry Palace is not confined by its architectural grandeur or artistic treasures but rather, it is one that transcends time. It is a symbol of the cultural confluence that defines the state and even today it is a reminder of the region’s resplendent history of trade, cultural exchange and diplomacy.

     <h3>History</h3>
The palace was built and gifted by the Portuguese as a present to the king of Cochin, around 1545.[1] It was built to appease the king after they plundered a temple nearby.[3][4] The landing of Vasco da Gama, the Portuguese explorer, at Kappad in 1498 was welcomed by the Kochi rulers. The Portuguese were given exclusive right to construct factories and they repulsed the repeated attacks of the Zamorians, and the Cochin Rajas practically became vassals of the Portuguese. The influence of the Portuguese was supplanted by the Dutch, and they took over Mattancherry in 1663.[3] Subsequently, the area was taken over by Hyder Ali and still later by the British East India Company.

 <h3>Architecture</h3>

The palace is a quadrangular structure built in Nālukettu style, the traditional Kerala style of architecture, with a courtyard in the middle. Certain elements of architecture, as for example the nature of its arches and the proportion of its chambers are indicative of European influence in basic Nālukettu style.[3][4]

<h3>Murals</h3>

Several murals depicting Hindu religious art adorn the walls of the palace.
There a large number of murals on the walls of the palace, executed in the traditions of Hindu temple art, which are religious, decorative and stylised. The murals have been painted in rich warm colours in tempera technique.[3]

<h3>Other exhibits</h3>
Portraits of the Rajas of Cochin, from 1864 onwards, are displayed in what was once the Coronation Hall. These were painted by local artists in the western style. The ceiling of the hall is decorated with floral designs in woodcraft. Amongst the other exhibits in the palace are an ivory palanquin, a howdah, royal umbrellas, ceremonial dress used by the royalty, coins, stamps and drawings.[3]

<h3>Restoration</h3>
In 1951, the palace was restored and declared a central government protected monument. The palace underwent a second restoration by the Archaeological Survey of India. The work which started in 2007 was completed by 2009.[5]</p>

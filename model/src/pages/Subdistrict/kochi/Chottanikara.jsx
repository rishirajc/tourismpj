A visit to the temple brings relief to them from the overburdening anguish and agonies of material life. The sacred doors of the sanctum sanctorum open in the wee hours of the day, at 4.00 a.m. The blowing of the conch and playing of the temple musical instruments lend an enchanting ritualistic rhythm and peace to those who seek a sure answer to the patient prayers. Sree Mookambika Saraswathy is also believed as present in the temple in the morning. That is why Mookambika Temple at kollur opens only after the Goddess Saraswathy returns to there late in the morning.
</p>
<p>On the eastern side of the temple pond stands the Kizhukkavu temple.The idol facing westward is belived to be installed by Villwamangalam Swamiyaar. After the Athazha pooja (main pooja in the evening), the chief priest of the principal deity comes to Kizhukkavu to perform the famous and great pooja "ValiyaGuruthy" (great Sacrifice). The Guruthy is prepared in 12 cauldrons (huge vessel) and is performed at about 8.45 p.m every night. Those who witness the guruthy performance, which itself is awe inspiring and prolonged ceremony, finds it an experience which is indescribable. Being present here during Valiya guruthy on Fridays permanently cures women suffering from mental abnormalities like schizophrenia. An ancient 'Pala' tree standing on the northeastern side of the sanctum sanctorum is covered with long iron nails hammered on by haunted victims with their foreheads.</p>

<p>The Chottanikkara (correction of Jyotiannakkara) Devi Temple is a temple dedicated to the Hindu mother goddess Bhagavati Lakshmi.[1] She is believed to be residing in Chottanikkara (Mahalakshmi) along with her Husband Maha Vishnu. The main deity is also considered as Lakshmi Narayana according to the temple legend.[2] The temple is Classified one among the 108 Abhimana Kshethram of Vaishnavate tradition. The temple is located at Chottanikkara, a southern suburb of the city of Kochi in Ernakulam district, in the state of Kerala, India and is one of the most popular temples in the state.

Sree Mahamaya Bhagavati is one of the most popular deities in Kerala and the supreme mother goddess in Hinduism. Chottanikkara Devi (Melekavu Bhagavathi) is worshipped at the temple, in three different forms: as Mahasaraswati in the morning, draped in white; Mahalakshmi in noon, draped in crimson; and as Mahakali in the evening, decked in blue. Devotees chant "Amme Narayana, Devi Narayana, Lakshmi Narayana, Bhadre Narayana" in this temple. Goddess 'Keezhkkaavu bhagavathi' is believed to be Bhadrakali, in her fierce form or Ugra form.

In terms of temple architecture, the Chottanikkara temple stands out to be an ultimate testimonial to the ancient transl. hi – transl. vishwakarma sthapathis (wooden sculpture) along with Sabarimala temple.

The temple is also known for conducting exorcism.[3]People suffering from mental illnesses and commonly visit the temple, as Chottanikkara Devi is said to cure her devotees. Guruthi pooja is a ritual done in the late evening to invoke the goddess Mahakali. Earlier 'Guruthi Pooja' was done only on Fridays. But nowadays, it is performed every day.</p>
<p> <h3>Legend</h3>
The area in which the temple is situated was once a dense jungle. A tribesman named Kannappan used to live in this forest. He was a devout worshipper of the goddess Mahakali, and would ritually sacrifice a buffalo to her every Friday (the day of the Goddess). One day, he found a calf near the forest. He kidnapped the calf and took her to his stone altar. Just before he is about to sacrifice the calf, his daughter Pavizham stepped in and pleaded to him to stop the sacrifice. The man loved his daughter and thus let her keep the calf as a pet. Unfortunately, Pavizham died some days later, possibly due to a snake bite. Kannappan broke into tears and decided to cremate her body. To his surprise, his daughter's corpse disappeared. A nearby priest told him the reason for such an occurrence; Kannappan used to forcibly take young calves from their mothers and sacrificed them. As punishment, he met the same fate when his daughter died. When the tribesman looked for the calf, he found the sacrifice alter shining in its place. The priest explained that the calf represented the divine couple, Lord Vishnu and Lakshmi. He asked Kannapan to pray before the alter everyday to undo his sins.[2]

Since Kannappan's death, the stones were forgotten. The stone was rediscovered accidentally by a low caste grass cutter, who found that blood was oozing out of a stone which she had accidentally cut. Horrified at what she saw, she brought the matter to the public's attention. A nearby priest was called to solve the problem. After devaprasnam, it was concluded that the stone was divine. That day, the elder Brahmin of the Yedattu house came along with some puffed rice in a coconut shell and this was offered to the Goddess for the first time. Even today this system of offering puffed rice in a coconut shell continues. The Brahmins of Yedattu house became the hereditary priests at this temple since those days.

Another legend associated to the temple is that of the spiritual leader Shankaracharya. During the time where he lived, Adi Shankara realised that there wasn't a single temple in Kerala that signified the worship of goddess Mahasaraswati. As a result, he himself went to the kashmir and meditated for many days for the goddess to appear before him. His meditation bore fruit and before him stood the stunningly beautiful goddess, clad in white. On enquiry, he said that he would like to bring the goddess to Kerala and establish a temple dedicated to her worship. This way the people from Kerala would not have to go such far off distances to worship her, as in the case for those who were old and aged. After a lot of persuasion, the goddess agreed; she would follow him by foot wherever he went, but only on one condition. If he trusts her, then he was not allowed to look back to see if she followed him or not. If he did, then wouldn't go any further. He agrees and they proceed walking. They were walking down the Kodachadri hills, with Shankara leading the way and goddess' anklets tinkling and letting him know that she was with him. After walking some distance, the tinkling stopped all of a sudden. Shankara waited a few moments and stole a quick look backwards to find the goddess still with him, watching him with reproach. In keeping with the condition, the goddess stopped right there. This is the spot which would turn out to be the Mookambika temple. Shankara, however, was not one to give up. He apologized profusely for breaking the condition and repeatedly begged and pleaded with the goddess to go with him to Kerala. After many pleas, the goddess agrees to a compromise and came to Chottanikara in Kerala, where the Chottanikara temple stood.

From early hours of morning, goddess would come and appear before the devotees at the Chottanikkara temple in the form of Goddess Mahasaraswati. Then in the afternoon, she would return to the Mookambika temple (spot where she stopped). Since then, the sanctum doors of the Chottanikkara temple were opened during early morning hours in honour of worshipping goddess Mahasaraswati before the doors of the main sanctum in Mookambika temple were opened.

<h3>Legend behind Keezhkavu</h3>
The idol at Keezhkavu didn't come until after the temple was built. Here is a legend that believed to be happened at least 3 or 4 centuries before. One night, a Brahmin by name Gupthan Namboodiri who was pursued by a disguised Yakshi (an evil spirit), while on a visit to meet his Guru Kosapilli Namboodiri who practiced occult sciences. It seems, the Yakshi took the form of a pretty maiden and tried to entice Gupthan. Since he was carrying a manuscript copy of Devi Mahatmyam, she was not able to do him any harm. However, Gupthan was attracted to her. Later when he reached Kosapilli Namboodiri's house, Gupthan narrated the incident to his guru and the guru deduced that the lady was a Yakshi. He then gave Gupthan Namboodiri an enchanted towel and rice to carry along on his return journey to protect himself from the Yakshi. When Gupthan saw the Yakshi following him he ran towards the Chottanikkara temple, on the way he threw the rice and swirled the towel at the Yakshi which slowed her and on reaching, jumped into the compound of the temple sanctum. The Yakshi who was pursuing him could only catch hold of his feet. When Gupthan cried out for help the mother Goddess Bhagavathy, she came out as Maha Kali and beheaded the Yakshi with her pallivaalu(divine Sword) and threw the yakshi's head into the temple tree base and then wash of the blood in the temple pond. That pond is known today as Yakshikulam or Rakthakulam, where the Kali idol was found merely a hundred years later by Vilwamangalam of Guruvayoor.

<h3>Makam Thozhal</h3>

Temple Pond
The annual Chottanikkara Makam Thozhal is the major festival in Chottanikara temple. Tradition states that it was on this day (mithuna lagna on Makam) that the Vilvumangala Swamiyar saw the goddess at the temple and the devotees continue to worship the goddess at the temple into the present day.[4]

On the Makam Thozhal day, the ritualistic bath of goddess in the morning at the sacred pond Calli Onakkuttichira far on the northern side of the temple.[4] After that, the goddess is brought to the temple accompanied by Lord Sastha on the back of seven caparisoned elephants march towards the "Pooraparambu" the traditional vantage point where they remain till 11 a.m.

At the mid-day the door of Sanctum Sanctorum closes for Ucha pooja. And re-opens at 2 p.m for the "Makam Darsanam", the time at which Vilvumangala Swamiyar saw the goddess at the temple.[4] At that time Devi who appears in her sacred full-fledged splendour and glory decked in her sacred gold ornaments, precious jewellery and innumerable garlands. This is exactly the form of vision which Villwamangalam Swamiyar was believed to have had when he faced westward after the "Prathishta" (installation) of Kizhukkavu Bhagavathy (Bhadrakali), Chottanikkara Devi appears at this moment clad in glittering clothes brilliant ornaments and fine jewellery with her four arms bearing varam, Abhayam, Shank and Chakram (Offering gift and refuge) to her ardent devotees. It is fervently believed that Darsanam at this moment will result in the fulfillment of all prayers and cherished desires. It is fervently believed that those who gain Darsanam at this crucial Mithuna Lagna, will be blessed with the fulfillment of their long standing desire and prayers.

<h3>Worship practices</h3>

Mahakali, Mahalakshmi and Mahasaraswati
The deity of Devi is believed to be a swayambu deity which means it's self- manifested and not sculpted. Hence the Devi's vigraham in this temple appears to be in 'rock' form which resembles a texture like rudraksha and now it's covered by a Bronze plate, which is sculpted with Devi's Roopam. There's another small black-coloured stone deity(shaligrama) found beside the Devi's vigraham which is believed to be a manifestation of Vishnu. Hence the presiding deity of the Rudraksha rock is believed to be Goddess Lakshmi.

The presiding deity is known by various names like Rajarajeswari, Mahalakshmi, Durga, Bhagavati, Aadi Parashakthi and Amman. Bhagavati is worshipped as Mahasaraswati in the morning, Mahalakshmi in the noon and Mahakali in the evening along with Lord Narayana.

There are sub-shrines for Lord Shiva, Lord Ganapathi, Lord Dharmasastha, Snake deities, Brahmarakshassu and Yakshi in this temple.

The temple is known for curing mental illness and disorders due to evil spirits. The patients are brought to the priest(melsanthi), who engages with them in some conversation. He nails a part of the hair of the patient in the temple tree, indicating that evil spirit is captured in the tree and the patients are cured off their illness. Neem leaves, lime and chillies are taken home from the temple, which are believed to ward off evil spirits.[5]

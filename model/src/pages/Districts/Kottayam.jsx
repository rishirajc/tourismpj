      <h1  style={{backgroundColor:"lightgreen"}}>ABOUT KOTTAYAM</h1>
      <p>Kottayam (IPA: [ko:ʈ:ayam]) is a city in the Kottayam district of Kerala, India. It is the district headquarters of the district and is located about 151 km (93.8 mi) north of the state capital Thiruvananthapuram. As per the 2011 Indian census, Kottayam has a population of 489,615 people, and a population density of 4,533/km2 (11,740/sq mi). The total Kottayam Metropolitan area (the combined area of Kottayam municipality and its adjacent suburbs) has a population of 802,419 people, and a population density of 3,647/km2 (9,450/sq mi).

Kottayam is also referred to as "the City of Letters" as many of the first Malayalam daily newspapers, such as Deepika, Malayala Manorama, and Mangalam, were started and are headquartered in Kottayam, as are a number of publishing houses</p>
      <h3  style={{backgroundColor:"lightgreen"}}>History</h3>
<h4  style={{backgroundColor:"lightgreen"}}>Thekkumkur rule (1103 - 1753)</h4>
<p>From the beginning of the ninth century AD, the history of Thekkumkur and of Kottayam are virtually indistinguishable. Kottayam was then a part of Vempolinad, an area in the Kulashekara Empire (800 AD – 1103  AD). By 1103, the Kingdom of Vempolinad had split into the Kingdoms of Thekkumkur and Vadakkumkur, and the latter became a vassal of Cochin.[4][5]

The royal house had originally been situated in Vennimala in Kottayam. It was protected by a fort known as Thaliyilkotta and, as a result, the locality came to be known by the same name as the fort. Afterward, Thekkumkur kings shifted their capital to Nattassery near Kumaranallore at the outskirts of Kottayam town. It is believed that the Thekkumkur dynasty ruled Kottayam from Thazhathangadi. Rulers of Munjanad and Thekkumkur had their headquarters at Thazhathangadi in the present Kottayam town. Marthanda Varma of Travancore attacked Thekkumkur and destroyed the palace and the Thaliyil fort. The remnants of the palaces and forts are still seen here.

The Portuguese and the Dutch established trade relations with both of these kingdoms, dealing in black pepper and other spices. After the subjugation of the Dutch East India Company by the Kingdom of Travancore in the 1741 Travancore–Dutch War, military operations of Marthanda Varma progressed against the northern neighboring kingdoms, including Thekkumkur.</p>
<h4  style={{backgroundColor:"lightgreen"}}>Travancore rule (1753 - 1949)</h4>
<p>Though Thekkumkur allied with Chempakassery and Vadakkumkoor to protect the kingdom, all of them were finally annexed to Travancore.[6] Another source states that the ruler of Thekkumkur had sided first with the Kingdom of Kayamkulam and then with the principality of Ambalapuzha against Travancore. After the fall of Ambalapuzha, and as the ruler of Thekkumkur refused to come to terms with Travancore, his capital city was taken on 11 September 1750 by Ramayyan Dalawa, the general and prime minister of Marthanda Varma, and the state was annexed to Travancore in 1753.

By the early 19th century, Travancore became a Protectorate of Britain after a series of unfair treaties. In 1817, the Church Missionary Society established CMS College as the first Western-style college in Kerala. It was welcomed by the Travancore government to provide administrators for the public bureaucracy.[7]


Mahatma Gandhi at Vaikom Satyagraha
Kottayam has played its role in all the political agitations of modern times. The ‘Malayali Memorial ‘ agitation may be said to have had its origin in Kottayam. The Malayali Memorial sought to secure better representation for educated Travancoreans in the Travancore civil service against persons from outside. The Memorial, which was presented to the Maharaja Sri Moolam Thirunal (1891) was drafted at a public meeting held in the Kottayam Public Library. The event marked the beginning of the modern political movement in the State.[1]

It was here that the famous Vaikom Satyagraha (1924–25), an epic struggle for eradication of untouchability, took place. Scheduled castes and other backward classes in Travancore were denied not only entry into temples, but also access to temple roads. Vaikom, the seat of a celebrated Siva Temple, was the venue of the symbolic satyagraha.[8] Due to these protests, the Maharaja Chithira Thirunal Balarama Varma issued the Temple Entry Proclamation in 1936.</p>
<h4  style={{backgroundColor:"lightgreen"}}>Contemporary period (1949 - Present)</h4>
<p>Kottayam became a revenue division of Travancore.[2] A fifth division, Devikulam, existed for a short period but was later added to Kottayam. At the time of the integration of the State of Travancore and Cochin in 1949, these revenue divisions were redesignated as districts and the Diwan Peshkars gave way to district collectors, with the Kottayam district established in July 1949</p>

Unni R. a story writer and scriptwriter, is also from Kottayam. Kottayam was the first town in India to have achieved 100% literacy.[19] Kottayam Public Library was founded in 1882 by T Rama RaoDewanPeshkar (Collector) of Northern Division of Travancore State.[20]

<h4  style={{backgroundColor:"lightgreen"}}>Education </h4>
In the 17th century, a Dutch school was started at Kottayam, which was short-lived. The first English school in Kerala, and the first college in India, was established in 1817 by the Church Missionary Society of England under the leadership of Col. John Munro, as CMS College.[7] Later in 1891, the clergies of Catholic Church, under the leadership of Fr Charles Lavigne, established St Berchmans English High School, Changanassery, one of the first residential English High School in Central Travancore. On seeing a need for instituition for higher education in Kottayam - Malabar region, under the leadership of Venerable Mar Thomas Kurialacherry, Bishop of Archeparchy of Changanassery with help of Syro Malabar Catholic Church, established the famous SB College in Changanasserry in 1922. Today CMS College Kottayam and SB College Changanasserry stands as a landmark and has made a huge contribution to education in the district. Thus, Kottayam became India's first town with 100% literacy in 1989.[21]
